Yes.

Everyone I love,

00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,210
why do they all leave me like this?

I will not go through the marriage.

In this situation now, if you too act like this...

57
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,440
I know I've been given more than my share.

58
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,790
But until now,

59
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,480
not even once, have I ever had something I really wanted.

60

If you're not saying that you'll marry Se Yeon 
and work hard for the company, get out!

What I want to protect is that woman!

62
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:27,280
If you want to talk about something like that, 
I don't need to hear it anymore! Get out, boy!

63
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,660

00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,980
Would you be alright to let Min Hyeok go like that?

67
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,650
Don't worry.

68
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:56,720
Min Hyeok will come back.

00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,190
He's my child.

71
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:08,060
Min Hyeok, that kid. This time is different.

72
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:14,150
That woman, find out about her more thoroughly.

73
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,220
Yes.

<i>SEOUL 
06 TA 7183</i>

75
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,830
What happened?

76
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:16,490
Like what Kang Yoo Jeong said, the fact that her car almost collided with a truck at the scene of the accident,

77
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,820
was true.

78
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,660
When he met with the police, 
why did he say he pretended not to know?

79
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,000
What was that barrel also about?

80
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,590
Because the vehicle was carrying additional weight,

81
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,860
the driver said he didn't want to get involved 
in a some problem.

82
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,390
The evidence?

83
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:33,470
That... The blackbox has never existed, and

84
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:37,830
because of the rain, he said he couldn't see 
the driver of the other vehicle.

85
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,540
That truck driver,

86
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,970
has he ever talked to anyone about this incident?

87
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,270
Probably not.

88
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:57,430
He seemed to remember only after I had asked him.

89
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:00,200
Then, go see that driver again.

90
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,740
I said if there was no evidence, make one. 
You remember that, right?

91
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:05,520
Even so...

92
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,730
There is one truth,

93
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:11,060
the one who drove was Ahn Do Hoon.

94
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,620
I don't know if I should be doing this...

95
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,190
Thank you.

96
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,740
Thank you, Unni!

97
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,560
Alright, take good care of your work, and

98
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,790
I'll be going.

99
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:50,180
On the day my dad disappeared, where did you go?

100
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:52,310
Get out.

101
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:55,050
When you were taking my dad, how was it?

102
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:59,300
"Where should I abandon him?". 
Did you think something like that?

103
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:19,640
What would this be?

104
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,480
What are you trying to do?

105
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,400
What am I trying to do,

106
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,590
wouldn't you <i>the Attorney </i>know better?

107
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,980
Why?

108
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,460
When you took my dad and abandoned him,

109
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:52,100
did you not think about things like this?

110
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,310
You said I was grabbing your ankle?

111
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,620
No.

112
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,110
The actions you have taken

113
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,710
will be grabbing your ankle.

114
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,110
I'm just coming from meeting Chairman Jo.

115
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,150
It's the data about you. 2 pages in all.

116
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,440
They're not interested in how dramatically you have lived.

117
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,720
Your education, your estate, and your family relationships.

118
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,070
And, the record of your conviction.

119
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:32,020
With those things, their evaluation of you is complete.

120
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,360
Do you want to go steady with Jo Min Hyeok or something?

121
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,420
Don't concern yourself.

122
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,550
Ruining me wasn't enough,

123
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:41,730
you want to ruin Jo Min Hyeok, too?

124
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:44,260
Jo Min Hyeok who chose you

125
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:47,250
will get it all taken away with nothing left.

126
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,710
If you do that, I would be thankful, but.

127
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:49,680
Stop that!

128
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:52,070
Get a hold of yourself.

129
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,260
Do you know what your problem is?

130
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,130
Because of that damn love,

131
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:00,320
it's that you can't even take care of your own issues.

I've been wanting to see you.

136
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:05,380
The person who stands here with public recognition,

137
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,290
who do you think it'll be?

138
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:10,540
Rather than public recognition,

139
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:14,140
isn't the heart of the person you'll be with 
more important?

140
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:19,160
I wonder what kind of confidence that is.

141
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,410
This marriage,

142
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:23,730
it's probably something that will make both of you unhappy.

143
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:28,150
This unhappiness, 
don't you think you are the one causing it?

144
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,870
Stop using Min Hyeok.

145
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:38,300
You shouldn't mess with a man belonging to another, 
 in order to get back the man who left you.

146
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,710
You asked to break up with Do Hoon first, then

147
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:44,040
are you hanging around like this, 
because you still have lingering feelings?

148
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,780
I don't regret breaking up with him.

149
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,650
That I didn't let him go earlier,

150
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:52,260
is all I regret.

151
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:55,880
Even while knowing that he didn't love me,

152
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,520
yet holding onto him stubbornly, is what I regret.

153
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,290
Holding onto a heart that has already left,

154
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,780
isn't love.

155
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,990
It's obsession.

156
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,070
Don't get cute.

157
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:27,740
Since I got hit, I'll say one more thing.

158
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:32,970
Your face with expectations of a marriage,

159
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:36,060
not even once looked happy,

160
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,760
never.

161
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,230
Did you wait for a long time?

162
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,000
It's what I'm good at.

163
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,290
Why did you wait, not knowing when I'd come?

164
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,470
You should have at least called.

165
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:46,700
Because I'm not following you around, 
you feel a bit empty, right?

166
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,600
Did something happen today?

167
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,740
I couldn't contact you all day.

168
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,990
No.

169
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:02,460

170
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,550
Yes.

171
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:07,030
But,

172
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,880
I can't think of anything now that I've seen you.

173
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,780
Why did you dress so light?

174
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:22,060
Because I wanted to walk a bit.

175
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:26,620
You're cold too.

176
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,000
I'm not cold.

177
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:34,070
I've worked at a ski resort for a long time, and

178
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,340
since I felt all the cold I could then,

179
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,030
now this much is fine.

180
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,770
Is there anything you haven't done?

181
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,390
I told you I don't drink sweet things.

182
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,720
If you drink it when it's cold, it's delicious.

183
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:54,270
The marriage...

184
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,460
I'm not going to do it.

185
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,670
Why no response?

186
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,090
This is entirely because of you, so you

187
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,240
can't run away.

188
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:18,420
<i>♫ For me to have</i>

189
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,500
Thank you...

190
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,510
And...

191
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,030
I'm sorry.

192
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:28,510
Why are you thankful?

193
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,140
It's me who should be thankful.

194
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:36,420
<i>♫ Who is not suitable</i>

195
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,850
<i>♫ I love one person</i>

196
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:42,380
<i>♫ That person is you</i>

197
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,190
Well...

198
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:48,240
Ah...

199
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,620
There's that...you know...

200
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,540
leaning on my shoulder...

201
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,830
<i>♫ If I can, my love.</i>

202
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:05,860
<i>♫ Love or farewell.</i>

203
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:09,540
<i>♫ In the world where there is none.</i>

204
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:15,930
<i>♫ I want to meet once again.</i>

205
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:23,150
<i>♫ Hot enough to get burned. 
♫ The tears in my heart.</i>

206
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:28,330
<i>♫ If I can pour it out to you.</i>

207
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:34,100
<i>♫ My love. 
♫ Love or farewell.</i>

208
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,920
<i>♫ In the world where there is none.</i>

209
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:43,480
<i>♫ I want to meet once again.</i>

210
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,560
<i>♫ My love.</i>

211
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:51,060
You are a lonely man who lives alone on a deserted island.

212
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,980
Suddenly at that moment, 3 women appear.

213
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:57,630
No. 1. 
Her face is pretty but she narrates directly.

214
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:00,990
No. 2. 
Her heart is like tofu but she uses informal speech.

215
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:03,120
It was right then!

216
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:07,140
Oops!

217
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,870
What is that bright smile?

218
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:11,170
It is extremely sexy.

219
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,940
The third woman.

220
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,090
Look at me! 
Look at me!

221
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:18,150
1! 2! 3! Alright!

222
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,690
You who are wise.

223
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:22,620
Who will you choose between the 3 women?

224
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,810
Unni!

225
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:25,460
I am done listening! 
Where are the 3 women?

226
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,120
I am the only woman here. 
You are both old.

227
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,320
Hey! At every chance you bring up age!

228
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,010
If you are old, you are not a woman?

229
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:35,180
Till when do you think you will be young?

230
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,580
There is always a drinking party here.

231
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,700
What are you doing here?

232
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,200
What time is it that you are scolding the guy?

233
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,200
Make him work after you feed him and let him sleep.

234
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,610
Oh! President!

235
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,780
You have become deeper.

236
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:58,740
But can I ask how, how much, where and what you did with Yoo Jeong at this late hour?

237
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,980
Are you investigating? 
What is it to you what the two of them do?

238
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,850
Why?

239
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:05,650
Why don't you go play with him some more?

240
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:11,020
Is this the only snack there is? 
I will make something.

241
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,340
Why do you have to go? 
 Sit down.

242
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,720
Ahjumma!

243
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,190
Ahjumma, you go get the snacks.

244
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,700
Look here, Ahjussi.

245
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,660
It is because my hair is permed. 
If I straighten it...

246
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,340
I'm like her.

247
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,100
Gwang Soo!

248
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,220
What did that ahjumma say?

249
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,220
I think she will be prettier with her hair straightened out.

250
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,330
Sit down.

251
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:35,210
Oh, seriously!

252
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:38,000
Oh, Jesus! Your taste is really vintage!

253
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:42,620
- Aigo! 
- Yes, yes! Don't say anything.

254
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,240
Stay still. Here.

255
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:52,720
Please check the debt ratio.

256
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:56,880
I will call you back.

257
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,860
Se Yeon!

258
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,770
The Chairman's illness seemed more severe 
than the rumors.

259
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:07,270
The surgery was successful.

260
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:09,710
We are watching the results.

261
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:15,410
I told you that there isn't anyone 
who knows Min Hyeok as much as me, didn't I?

262
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:19,890
No matter how crazy he is over a woman, Min Hyeok...

263
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:22,100
can't abandon his family.

264
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:27,020
Shake up the K-Group.

265
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,290
If the Chairman collapses,

266
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:31,360
he will return.

267
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,780
More than anticipated,

268
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,010
it may take longer?

269
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:41,820
I am not that foolish, Chairman.

270
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,600
I have already arranged the means to escape.

271
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:09,110
I will meet with Min Hyeok.

272
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:25,100
I heard about you.

273
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,600
What did Father say?

274
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:31,250
The Chairman's progress isn't good.

275
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:34,220
He needs to get medical treatment briefly.

276
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:37,720
We are going to make it seem like he went down because of the foreign resort business.

277
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:42,890
When I'm not there, if even you aren't there...

278
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:45,640
the company will be in difficulty.

279
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,680
It was bound to happen.

280
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,340
It is just a little confusing because the preparations are not completed.

281
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:55,550
You have to be a support.

282
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:57,460
Hyung...

283
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:00,040
I definitely told you.

284
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,180
It is not a determination that will change so easily...

285
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,200
This is the key to the company safe-deposit box.

286
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,700
While I am absent, you take care of it.

287
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,620
Hyung!

288
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,310
Whether you want it or not,

289
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:14,600
you're K Group's successor.

290
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,730
Attorney Ahn's file that you wanted.

291
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:38,070
It is in this safe-deposit.

292
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:42,390
Attorney Ahn is of help to the K-Group now.

293
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:45,450
But he knows too many of our cards.

294
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,590
We don't know when Ahn Do Hoon will return.

295
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:50,370
When Attorney Ahn becomes a threat to the K-Group.

296
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:53,450
This file will be of help.

297
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,820
President.

298
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,340
You thought I didn't see you, right?

299
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,340
Smile.

300
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:45,430
Please smile.

301
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:51,420
I want to see you smile.

302
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:17,600
I'm going.

303
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,330
<i>Documents concerning Ahn Do Hoon. </i>

304
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,240
<i>File Source: Shin Ah Foundation. </i>

305
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,700
<i>The President Dismissal Agenda for the Board. 
Drafter:Ahn Do Hoon. </i>

306
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,540
Shin Se Yeon.

307
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,480
Shin Se Yeon!

308
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:22,550
Indeed,

309
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:24,640
you only come when you need me.

310
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,730
Really, why are you like this?

311
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,910
What about this kind of stuff?

312
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:42,720
The K-Group will not collapse because of this matter.

313
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,570
But will Se Gwang and Shinha just let this good opportunity pass?

314
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:47,330
What are you plotting again?

315
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:50,080
What I am up to.

316
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:54,310
You know it too.

317
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:58,680
I am not one to let go of something in my hands.

318
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,620
If you want to protect your company,

319
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,910
grab onto my hand.

320
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,330
What's that supposed to mean?

321
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:07,390
If the image of the company becomes bad,

322
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:10,870
more than anyone else, 
your father will oppose this marriage.

323
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:15,220
Isn't that what you wanted?

324
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,110
What I want...

325
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:22,140
is you.

326
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,480
You. You!

327
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:29,240
Don't say that you didn't now.

328
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,060
When you were having a hard time because of your mom,

329
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,600
when the Chairman kicked you out,

330
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:34,860
and even when that Seo Ji Hee died...

331
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:38,490
It was me who was by your side.

332
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,600
Se Yeon.

333
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,610
I love you.

334
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,980
I love you. I love you! I said I love you!

335
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:14,460
I'm sorry.

336
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:19,790
I'm sorry.

337
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:27,770
That woman and you, do you think it'll work out?

338
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,100
What happens to love that started because of revenge,

339
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,180
you asked me, didn't you?

340
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:47,860
That ending... I will make it for you.

341
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:22,060
Here's some more chilli.

342
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:22,850
Thank you.

343
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,420
Yes.

344
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,800
Welcome.

345
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,040
Please give me a bowl of Haejangguk (hangover soup).

346
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:39,310
We're closing now. Please leave.

347
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:43,000
There are still people eating.

348
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,810
Please give me it.

349
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:03,130
When a customer's asking for it, what are you doing?

350
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,770
Hurry and bring it.

351
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:18,700
Where do you think this is?

352
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,570
You came quickly.

353
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:25,790
You eat some too. Eat some and we'll talk.

354
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:30,870
You...you called Do Hoon here too?

355
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:33,510
You really, why -

356
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:35,160
Whose store are you trying to ruin that you are doing this?

357
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,580
Mom, don't worry about it.

358
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,710
Come out. Come out and let's talk.

359
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:43,420
Why? We can't talk here?

360
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:46,220
Sure, let's talk a bit here.

361
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:49,680
Now that Do Hoon's found a woman, let him breathe!

362
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,490
Why are you looking for us again and being like this?

363
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:52,420
A girl?

364
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:56,110
That's right.

365
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:58,180
She's a woman who paints.

366
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:01,400
In comparison to you-

367
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,280
Stop.

368
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:08,780
Shin Se Yeon..do you think she suits Oppa?

369
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,640
Do you think her family thinks the same?

370
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:16,230
You, come out. I said come out!

371
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:20,300
Do Hoon!

372
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,420
Stop it!

373
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:25,780
What? She did it first saying that she suits Do Hoon! 
So imprudent!

374
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:29,600
Leave those two to talk. Is that too hard?

375
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,410
Affection? What affection? 
Don't you go do that again needlessly!

376
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:38,170
She had his child! Do you think it's over when you say it?

377
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:43,970
Don't provide her with a reason to stick by him using the child as an excuse.

378
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:52,510
<i> Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office. 
Contents: arraignment. </i>

379
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,960
There is no use even if you sue.

380
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:09,450
You don't have any evidence! I warned you!

381
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:11,650
Is that so?

382
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:17,020
Then...

383
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,810
You like coming out on TV, right?

384
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:25,180
There is no use how much you squirm.

385
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:27,720
What will make you stop?

386
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:31,130
How do I make you stop? Shall I completely ruin Jo Min Hyeok?

387
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:35,540
He isn't such a terrible person to be broken by you.

388
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:40,290
Still that person... at least has sincerity.

389
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:42,720
Sincerity?

390
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,790
You still haven't gained hold of your senses.

391
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,570
You still believe that?

392
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:59,640
I believe him. You, who can't believe,

393
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,730
are pitiful.

394
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:14,470
It doesn't end here.

395
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:17,720
I will put you in court somehow.

396
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,940
In the place you looked up to,

397
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:25,820
I will make you admit it of your own accord.

398
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:43,430
Did you hear? 
The corporate lawyer got imprisoned.

399
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:45,090
Will it really go bankrupt?

400
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:48,000
I saw the article. 
It's no joke these days.

401
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,070
I saw the article. It's no joke.

402
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,270
What happens to us?

403
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:54,330
What do we do if it goes bankrupt?

404
00:35:54,330 --> 00:36:00,880
Unni! Our restaurant being taken over, is it true?

405
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,440
Kang Yoo Jeong, you seem to have a good relationship with the President,

406
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,690
did you hear anything?

407
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:15,720
We also got an investment and...

408
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:19,760
the menu-pan was also good. 
No way!

409
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:21,430
You know the least of all of us.

410
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:25,750
There is no problem with the restaurant. 
The main office will face problems.

411
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,320
Then they will fold this kind of business first.

412
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,120
Then will just the name change?

413
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,640
Will we all get fired?

414
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,470
Ah! My card debt!

415
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:38,210
If I don't pay this month's rent, she will grab my hair again!

416
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:41,460
- I bough a bag last month. 
- What to do?

417
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:44,520
I had expected that you sent the document to the Board of Directors.

418
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,730
It was no fun because it was too obvious.

419
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:49,770
I just informed the truth.

420
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:53,280
There is nothing I did well either, 
so I didn't come to quibble about it.

421
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,260
Bring Attorney Choi Gwang Min out somehow.

422
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,600
I will do that.

423
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,450
You will definitely have to do it.

424
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:04,160
There is a file of Hyung's investigation on you.

425
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,880
You never know.

426
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,940
If you continue to be of help to the K-Group,

427
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:13,390
even if you go into jail for the hit-and-run, 
Hyung will bring you out somehow.

428
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:18,630
And..this.

429
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:25,570
Listen to it when you're bored.

430
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:29,790
It is the recording of the truck driver. 
It was interesting.

431
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:33,400
If you hear it, the things you did in the past

432
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:37,300
You will

433
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:22,110
I think the proceedings will become difficult.

434
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:25,230
The painting that you sent to the Director of the National Tax Service.

435
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:28,330
It was bought from Shin Ah Foundation.

436
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:34,170
If the

437
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:35,040
So?

438
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,890
This is your chance. I will let you go.

439
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:45,620
For the Chairman and Jo Min Hyeok, are you going to give up on your life like this?

440
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:50,240
You don't have a reason to worry about my life so much.

441
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,560
What is it that you want?

442
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:58,700
I heard that there was information concerning me.

443
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:01,710
When I was young..

444
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:06,080
I was a fan of chivalry books.

445
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,630
But the pattern is always the same.

446
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:12,960
Always the nearest person betrays.

447
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,450
Hand over... the material.

448
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:20,680
Attorney Ahn, you and I, our origin is similar.

449
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:28,110
We were born with nothing but thankfully we were smart so we came all the way here.

450
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:32,630
You know what makes us different?

451
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:34,010
This is your last chance.

452
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:39,230
That you won't strike me in the back because you can't have it.

453
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:42,440
Isn't betrayal too obvious?

454
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,380
Didn't you see it till you are fed up of it in reality and in books?

455
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,880
Sunbaenim!

456
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:54,910
I really wanted to do this once.

457
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:57,530
Instead of looking for the way I can live,

458
00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:00,030
the person I have to protect...

459
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:02,800
I wanted to protect them.

460
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:06,160
Not in a chivalry book...

461
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:08,260
But in reality.

462
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:30,120
Jae Ha!

463
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:37,100
The 3rd generation of Se Gwang, how clumsy of you?

464
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:40,400
How can you be photographed in a picture like this?

465
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:50,720
It was your hyung who was photographed.

466
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,550
What?

467
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:56,890
It's information that your older brother has been buying Se Gwang Heavy Industries stocks since last year.

468
00:40:56,930 --> 00:41:01,970
While you were desiring K-Group, your older brother is making your shares useless.

469
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:04,060
Why are you telling me that?

470
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:08,040
You and I... 
it is true we aren't compatible.

471
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:11,320
Whenever I see you, I want to act perverse.

472
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:14,310
You and I are scum,

473
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:18,920
but let's stop the crap now.

474
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:23,770
The rumor about my father, was it you?

475
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:27,770
What is it that you want to say?

476
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:31,330
I stopped the photo with my hands.

477
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:36,330
It seems like your older brother is plotting with Shinha Hotel and trying to create bad rumors.

478
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,410
I like you more than your older brother.

479
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,640
What is it that you want?

480
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:43,980
When you feel like a drink,

481
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,860
call me.

482
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:52,790
Just because you do that, 
you think I won't acquire the restaurant?

483
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:57,450
That's why you have no friends, you idiot!

484
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:27,790
Sit down.

485
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:30,540
I called you because I have something to say.

486
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:45,720
You and I, there is no need to inquire about each other.

487
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:51,780
Because of you, Min Hyeok says that he won't go along with the marriage that is all prepared for.

488
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,390
Did you hear of the company's situation?

489
00:42:56,270 --> 00:43:00,580
Attorney Choi is like a real brother to Min Hyeok.

490
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:03,640
When a person like that sacrifices himself in the place of Min Hyeok for the company,

491
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,610
how do you think Min Hyeok would feel?

492
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,670
I am sorry.

493
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:09,400
If you are sorry, you should leave on your own.

494
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:15,450
Are you going to make him watch the business his father built collapse because of him?

495
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,160
A promise...

496
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:20,660
I made one.

497
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,840
Till the President tells me to go,

498
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:29,420
I promised I wouldn't go.

499
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:32,730
You don't understand what I am saying.

500
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,880
I am sorry.

501
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:38,520
If you can't understand, I must make you understand.

502
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:41,550
See you again.

503
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:55,370
Do it tomorrow. Why do it now?

504
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,970
They say if you leave dishes unwashed, you get worries.

505
00:43:58,970 --> 00:43:59,970
I am done.

506
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,830
Aren't you tired?

507
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,690
No.

508
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:19,990
Will the two of you really be alright?

509
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,860
Unni.

510
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,700
If I am this happy, I will be punished, right?

511
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,350
I thought it would be alright for one day.

512
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,340
But why do I want more?

513
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:36,050
You had a hard time and you hurt till now.

514
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,860
It's alright for you to smile now.

515
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:42,000
Even if it is hard, it's alright.

516
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,840
If it wasn't for that time, I couldn't have met you unnis.

517
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:49,690
And also the President.

518
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:53,460
That's right. 
If you are happy now, that will do.

519
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,030
Let's sleep.

520
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:09,650
It is material that will affect Shin Ah Foundation, too.

521
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:11,270
Are you handing it over being aware of it?

522
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:13,140
I know.

523
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:17,880
This will put, not only put K-Group but also you, in danger.

524
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:18,840
I can't do that.

525
00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:19,980
Do as you are told.

526
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:23,080
What is the reason you are going this far?

527
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:28,540
I want to see Min Hyeok kneel in front of me and beg me desperately to save him.

528
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:31,530
Before that, you will get hurt.

529
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,780
Then do what I want.

530
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:56,300
I can't! I won't!

531
00:45:56,350 --> 00:45:57,980
Jo Min Hyeok...

532
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,570
I will make him kneel in front of you.

533
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:09,010
I like that you are unchanging.

534
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:12,370
Then...

535
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:17,330
When I am really left alone,

536
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:21,470
will you hug me?

537
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,150
I will do that.

538
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,440
You are pretty.

539
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:50,040
You are prettier when you smile.

540
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:57,890
In case I fell asleep before you came,

541
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:02,620
I don't know how many cups I drank of this coffee that is only sweet.

542
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:41,490
Now I think I will live.

543
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:45,790
Yoo Jeong.

544
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:48,010
Yes.

545
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:50,450
Before me, you

546
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,830
shouldn't die first.

547
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,860
I will do that.

548
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,610
Father.

549
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:34,020
What brings you at this hour?

550
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:37,760
What is this, Do Hoon?

551
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:42,720
Tell me that it isn't.

552
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,820
Tell me that it isn't you.

553
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:46,850
Father.

554
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:49,660
Don't bother about things like this.

555
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:52,220
How can I not be bothered?

556
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:56,020
The things written here... 
What is all this?

557
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:01,350
That you... abandoned Yoo Jeong's father...

558
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:03,210
what is the meaning of all this?

559
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:05,360
Yoo Jeong...

560
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:08,860
is purposely doing this because she can't accept the fact that we have broken up.

561
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:10,020
It is nothing serious.

562
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:11,970
How can this be nothing serious?

563
00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:13,850
You saw how she came to the store last time, didn't you?

564
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:17,730
Yoo Jeong has changed. 
She isn't in her right mind!

565
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,760
Do Hoon! You...

566
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:26,000
Are you really my son?

567
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:31,760
I have a meeting. 
Go ahead home.

568
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,270
I...

569
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:38,630
I must meet Yoo Jeong.

570
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,940
I will meet her and hear the whole story.

571
00:49:41,970 --> 00:49:45,060
If she is angry, I will apologize.

572
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:47,580
I must ask for forgiveness.

573
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:49,500
For what?

574
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:55,460
It suffices that you have lived your whole life being sorry like you sinned. What more?

575
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:59,820
You want me to live like that, too?

576
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:04,310
Don't go see Yoo Jeong.

577
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:06,420
I will take care of it.

578
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,840
Please go home, first.

579
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,100
<i>Arraignment</i>

580
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:41,360
It wasn't enough to get Jo Min Hyeok involved,

581
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,980
did you even go to my father?

582
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,490
What would make you stop this?

583
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:48,970
I have no intention of stopping it.

584
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:52,900
You're still in that place, just the same.

585
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:55,950
Regarding your father,

586
00:50:57,770 --> 00:50:58,950
it was an accident.

587
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:01,040
Speak what is right.

588
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:06,450
It was not an accident, but murder.

589
00:51:06,450 --> 00:51:08,640
That can't become an evidence.

590
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,320
It doesn't matter.

591
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:14,770
If not at court, media, if not at media, wherever,

592
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:18,830
as long as I follow you and reveal it wherever you are.

593
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,900
I'm sorry.

594
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:48,480
How convenient.

595
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:52,140
I'm sorry, Yoo Jeong.

596
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,500
I'll see you at the Prosecutions Office tomorrow.

597
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,820
Because it's a familiar place,

598
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:01,910
you shouldn't have any problem finding it.

599
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:04,060
I told you

600
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:05,960
it was an accident

601
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:07,440
beyond my ability to interfere!

602
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,140
It's always beyond your ability to interfere.

603
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:15,470
Because of your parents, because of me, 
because of the elites!

604
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:18,670
What made your life like this

605
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:21,750
is no one else.

606
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:25,130
Don't blame the others so easily like that.

607
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:32,950
What nasty is this thing trying to pull here?

608
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:37,170
Where is this rotten smell coming from?

609
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:46,270
Are you leaving?

610
00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:50,020
Why don't you stay a bit? Someone you know will be here.

611
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,250
Hae Jin.

612
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:56,380
Lee Hae Jin.

613
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,860
You've even written a recommendation for her,

614
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:03,820
weren't you two close?

615
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:40,970
Se Yeon?

616
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:10,540
Do Hoon?

617
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:15,530
Like this...

618
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:20,970
It cannot end like this!

619
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:38,370
Did you come to see father?

620
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:42,020
He is busy with the resort business.

621
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:45,050
Not that he has gotten sicker?

622
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:46,420
Why did you come?

623
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:49,080
I'm hoping he gets better by the time we have our wedding.

624
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,400
Just why are you like this?

625
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:54,230
Are you asking because you don't know?

626
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:57,230
I'm trying to improve the value of your company 
that I heard is in trouble.

627
00:54:57,230 --> 00:54:59,310
I don't need your help.

628
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:01,060
I'll talk to your father.

629
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:03,160
I don't like that.

630
00:55:07,310 --> 00:55:08,440
Alright,

631
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,860
everything you say is right.

632
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:14,980
Thank you for being by my side, but

633
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:17,120
the marriage is not right.

634
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:20,800
To you, neither to Yoo Jeong, 
I won't live my whole life feeling sorry.

635
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,630
What can I do?

636
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:26,470
Because I want to have you by my side.

637
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:29,540
Being unhappy by my side for your whole life,

638
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:30,680
I have to see that.

639
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:31,380
Se Yeon?

640
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:34,280
Don't call me in a friendly tone.

641
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:36,740
It's not like you.

642
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:39,800
Does that woman always call you in a friendly tone like this?

643
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:20,610
Why?

644
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,990
Are you too scared to come?

645
00:56:25,970 --> 00:56:30,310
<i>Attorney Ahn, why would he be here?</i>

646
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:43,840
Shin Ah Foundation's artwork lobby 
that Attorney Choi was involved in,

647
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:48,150
if the people involved are exposed, 
the damage will be detrimental.

648
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:50,180
But, don't worry.

649
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:52,210
I can stop it.

650
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:55,080
<i>What are you doing now?</i>

651
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,700
This company the Chairman built

652
00:56:57,710 --> 00:57:00,180
will become harder in the future.

653
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:03,710
Choi Gwang Min, your loyal dog,

654
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:08,800
for something that can be resolved in a few months, 
I imagine he would have to rot for at least 10 years.

655
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:12,960
Of course, you would also be vulnerable.

656
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:21,000
While you were investing in the artworks, 
<i>the loss you incurred to K Capital is at least $27.5 mil.</i>

657
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,390
<i>The Prosecutions will see this as an embezzlement, 
intended to secure illicit funds.</i>

658
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,720
Get me the boss right now.

659
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:29,530
<i>Listen carefully.</i>

660
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:33,550
<i>The person who can best defend you,</i>

661
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:36,030
is none other than myself.

662
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:47,580
The person who can protect you,

663
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:52,500
none other than myself in K-Group's legal team,

664
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:55,030
<i>is Ahn Do Hoon.</i>

665
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:58,810
What are you going to do?

666
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,610
<i>Connection has ended 
Kang Yoo Jeong</i>

667
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:07,810
What is all this bull?

668
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:14,780
He is saying you and I, we both are going to be in trouble.

669
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:19,780
Make your decision. Live together, or

670
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:21,370
crumble together.

671
00:58:21,390 --> 00:58:24,070
Shin Se Yeon!

672
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,790
<i>♫ I believe that I love you</i>

673
00:58:45,790 --> 00:58:48,770

00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:52,790

00:58:52,790 --> 00:58:56,390
