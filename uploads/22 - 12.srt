<i>Secret</i>

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,780
Don't smile.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,580
You would smile like that,

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,400
are you also... going to leave me?

5
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,250
Once you get what you want,

6
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:26,660
you are also going to leave me.

7
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,090
You told me to do what you tell me.

8
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,850
Until you tell me to leave, Boss...

9
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,860
I will not go.

10
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:50,660
<i>♫ I made that person cry</i>

11
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:57,430
<i>♫ Because of my incredibly bad obsession</i>

12
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:04,650
<i>♫ If the tears steal the heart and disappear</i>

13
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:10,430
<i>♫ Because I thought she would come closer</i>

14
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,290
<i>♫ I believe that I love you</i>

15
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,330
<i>♫ It's shaking me like crazy</i>

16
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:21,200
<i>♫ I believe that I love you</i>

17
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,910
<i>♫ If this limping love of mine</i>

18
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:32,090
<i>♫ If it moves near, because you might hide from fear</i>

19
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:41,540
<i>♫ Even though I say I'm hurt as if I could die, I only watch</i>

20
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:56,730
<i>♫ If the tears knew my heart</i>

21
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:09,220
I was wondering how you entered the Recipe Contest, but

22
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:12,250
the taste isn't half bad.

23
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,100
How did you know...

24
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,230
Without even knowing that,

25
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,410
do you think I would've given you this work?

26
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,350
What?

27
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,230
I'll send Gwang Soo, so wait, alright?

28
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,590
What do you mean selling?

29
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,890
The board of directors made a decision today.

30
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,470
Once our financial team evaluates 
and comes up with a price,

31
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,250
it will go directly to the sales process.

32
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,630
If we secure invesment with the restaurant as a collateral,

33
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,280
we don't have to sell, right?

34
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,800
Where that kind of funding is possible,

35
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,170
Hannam-dong is the only place.

36
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,750
We can't sell the restaurant, before my father returns.

37
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,920
The decision will be made by my father!

38
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,220
I'll make an appointment,

39
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,340
but don't expect much.

40
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,580
Everybody wants a piece of the action, but

41
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,490
Hyung, isn't K-Group attractive to you?

42
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:04,760
Because he wanted more than what he deserves, 
even abandoning his children,

43
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,550
I grew up watching my father like that.

44
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:14,170
This much is sufficient for me.

45
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,870
Jo Min Hyeok was here.

46
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,230
It seems your expression is not happy.

47
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:52,860
No, I threw a good punch.

48
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,460
But, it didn't make me feel better.

49
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:02,320
You heard the Board of Directors' decision, right?

50
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,140
Jo Min Hyeok,

51
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:07,030
If he can't keep the restaurant management rights,

52
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,830
it will be more difficult in the future.

53
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:12,980
No. The way I see it, it won't be that difficult for Min Hyeok.

54
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,450
Seeing that he can't let go of what he has in his hand,

55
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:21,140
because that means he's still able to hold out.

56
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:33,260
Unni, sit down.

57
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,030
Unni, it's now fall.

58
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,780
Your skin can get cracked easily. 
You have to think of your age.

59
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,530
You're at the age where it is essential to take care.

60
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,890
Look at that, your lips are all chapped.

61
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,700
You don't have the right attitude for dating.

62
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,960
Unni... this

63
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,760
is as expensive as one month's worth of this place!

64
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,190
I'll give it to you.

65
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:00,320
Unni, you can't forget how well I treat you!

66
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,300
Hey! If you are able to put that on your face, 
 pay your monthly rent on time!

67
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:11,830
Unni, by the way, how far have you gone with the President?

68
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,710
Ha- have you gone as far as the lips?

69
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,280
Hey~ Hye Ri!

70
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,640
It seems I'm right!

71
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,960
I'll be back soon.

72
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,670
Aigoo. Bravo.

73
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:34,970
Rent?

74
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:38,920
♫ 3,4 Happy Birthday

75
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:43,930
♫ That song is too common so it's not for your birthday~

76
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:49,640
♫ So we would like to congratulate you with a new birthday song~

77
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:55,330
♫ Today is a joyful day. Today is a good day.
The world is beautiful.

78
00:06:55,330 --> 00:07:01,360
♫ Everyone get together with a happy mind 
 and celebrate...

79
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,340
♫ Happy birthday...

80
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,960
♫ We congratulate you~

81
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,600
Boss.

82
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,970
What?

83
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,620
Happy birthday to you.

84
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,230
What about my present?

85
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,100
I'm sorry.

86
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,440
♫ Happy birthday~

87
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,540
Tell Kang Yoo Jeong to come here.

88
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,560
♫ We congratulate you~

89
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,230
It's what you selected.

90
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,930
You explain, too.

91
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,180
Yes?

92
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,560
Have you completed the sauce you were making?

93
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,380
Yes.

94
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,430
We're going to meet the investor tomorrow.

95
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,480
We have to increase the value of the restaurant 
as high as possible.

96
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,680
Explain your recipe, and work on the plan again.

97
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,620
Boss,

98
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,240
That's not what I can do...

99
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,360
How are you going to get revenge working in a kitchen?

100
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:01,290
Don't kid yourself thinking I'll help you without reason.

101
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,200
Ahn Do Hoon,

102
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,490
he is fretting because he can't prey on this restaurant.

103
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:19,900
You just have to stop that. 
And I have to get back what is mine.

104
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,090
Then we both win. Okay?

105
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:34,590
What is it?

106
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,330
I got a call from the security office.

107
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,650
They said the restoration has been completed.

108
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,230
What happened?

109
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,200
You're here?

110
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:32,620
I didn't know that the busy Ahn Do Hoon would get here so quickly.

111
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,910
Anyway, I was just getting ready 
to watch something interesting.

112
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,740
Let's watch it together.

113
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,150
Gwang Soo, start it.

114
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,340
I only now remembered that Gwang Soo went to that cafe that night.

115
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,050
In order to show this to me,

116
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,540
did you called me?

117
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,840
Why?

118
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,050
Since you've seen it already,

119
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,840
there is nothing new?

120
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,590
Yes.

121
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:44,090
I was with Yoo Jeong that night.

122
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:47,960
So?

123
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:53,610
I can see what you're going after, but

124
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,050
the location captured on screen

125
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,400
is not the scene of the accident.

126
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,500
This can't become any evidence at all.

127
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,680
Then.

128
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,500
For something that can't be any evidence at all,

129
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:13,680
why would you so desperately find it, and

130
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,200
even erase it?

131
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,460
Why did you do it?

132
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,000
<i>RET</i>

133
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,300
<i>SECRET</i>

134
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,800
<i>SECRET 
12</i>

135
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,100
It's that son of a bitch.

136
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,050
The one who drove is also that son of a bitch!

137
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,800
Kang Yoo Jeong, you the woman just...

138
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,100
Just as what Ahn Do Hoon said, 
the blackbox by itself can't be an evidence.

139
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,590
If it can't be, make one!

140
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,880
Let's go to the Prosecutions Office.

141
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,460
Order one steak and one pasta.

142
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,790
Your order is here.

143
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:13,850
Thank you.

144
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,630
Enjoy.

145
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,460
Let's talk for a bit.

146
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,800
What did you get scared of, 
that you ran all the way here?

147
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,300
Did you tell him?

148
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,280
Did you tell Jo Min Hyeok that I drove?

149
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,280
Don't treat me like a worthless person.

150
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,950
The one who made me worthless is you.

151
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:48,340
Shackled by your great sacrifice, 
the one who is struggling is me!

152
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,930
I'm on company time.

153
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,490
If you have something to say, 
wait until I get off work.

154
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,750
The prosecutor and the suspect were having a relationship...

155
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,840
and that Prosecutor was Ahn Do Hoon?

156
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,600
So?

157
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,130
Is that all?

158
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,220
Shouldn't there be another trial?

159
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:13,860
When there is a concern that a decision can be made 
unjustly, because of the personal relationships,

160
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,740
he can be excluded at the trial stage.

161
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,180
But, Attorney Ahn gave a proper sentencing.

162
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,630
There won't be any problems legally.

163
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:26,400
It's possible for the suspect 
to file a motion for unfairness, but

164
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,380
that's not the case here.

165
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,050
If the suspect is not the culprit,

166
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,280
can you appeal for a retrial?

167
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,960
What are you talking about?

168
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:38,570
A retrial is something that will shake up 
the entire prosecution organization.

169
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:41,670
Without concrete evidence, it won't be accepted.

170
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,600
Why, is there an evidence?

171
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,090
If there is,

172
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,920
will you take the case, Hyung?

173
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,460
Who exactly is the culprit..

174
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,630
By any chance,

175
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,570
are you saying it's Attorney Ahn?

176
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,920
Do you have any other evidence?

177
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,780
So you can use it at a time like this,

178
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,470
have you hidden something?

179
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,380
I guess you're right.

180
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,300
Seeing you now, Oppa,

181
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:20,800
it would have been good if I had done that.

182
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,990
Anyway, with that,

183
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,330
you won't be able to implicate me.

184
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:29,670
I'm not enough of a coward to implicate you for that.

185
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:33,100
Don't lower me to your level.

186
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,840
Why?

187
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,420
Are you scared because you have too much to lose?

188
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,300
That position you're in now,

189
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:43,420
hold on to it.

190
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,840
Until I drag you down with my hands,

191
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,550
make sure to hold out.

192
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:52,380
What's the matter?

193
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,880
Are you alright?

194
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,920
Yes.

195
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,340
Please go carefully.

196
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:22,350
This is a place of work Kang Yoo Jeong.

197
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:26,380
Quit if you're going to go meet men during working hours.

198
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,510
Don't do as you please thinking that the President has got your back.

199
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,300
I'm sorry.

200
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,670
This kind of thing will not happen again.

201
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,300
Who did you meet?

202
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,300
Attorney Ahn

203
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,340
came to see me.

204
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,780
What for?

205
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,960
It was a personal matter.

206
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,590
Please don't misunderstand.

207
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:00,650
There is no other meaning...

208
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:04,090
I won't misunderstand... if you tell me not to.

209
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:26,100
That day, if you had not driven,

210
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:31,820
actually, if it was Ahn Do Hoon who drove,

211
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:38,730
then, you wouldn't have written me off like this.

212
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,250
No.

213
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,920
If...

214
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:48,490
Even if I had not driven,

215
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:51,170
I was at that place.

216
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:55,390
The night when that person passed away,

217
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:58,170
I was clearly at that place.

218
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:03,760
The anger you feel toward me, 
it's a matter of fact.

219
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,250
What you tell me to do is not hard.

220
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,130
Just that,

221
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,380
I forget everything, and

222
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:16,000
what if I go on living with smiles,

223
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,420
I'm more fearful of that.

224
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:55,450
<i>The customer you are calling is unavailable...</i>

225
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,050
Schedule another date.

226
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,880
At that time,

227
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:16,550
confirm Min Hyeok is here and after that, 
 call me.

228
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,640
Again, not like the practice, but a real thing.

229
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,300
Begin.

230
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,590
I said start.

231
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:41,230
♫ Today is a happy day. Today is a good day. 
The world is beautiful.

232
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,300
Again, again, again.

233
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,050
You're going to do it absentmindedly to the customers too?

234
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,450
With all sincerity while smiling.

235
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:51,750
Do a little dance too. I saw you doing it well earlier.

236
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,210
Look straight at me.

237
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:01,250
♫ Today is a happy day. Today is a good day. 
Now you try it.

238
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,340
I said do it.

239
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:08,590
What are you doing?

240
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:19,400
♫ Today is a happy day. Today is a good day. 
♫ The world is beautiful. - Louder.

241
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:24,090
♫ Everyone is gathered together with cheerful hearts

242
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:29,420
♫ Boss's birthday~

243
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:36,170
♫ Congratulations to you~

244
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:39,380
♫ Con..grat..ulate

245
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,420
Is this how you play?

246
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,950
It was so childish that I didn't want to cut in.

247
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:58,090
But I should still mind my manners.

248
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,420
Happy birthday.

249
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,920
Ah. right.

250
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,480
Sorry about the studio. Because I had work.

251
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,110
Work?

252
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,730
This kind of work.

253
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,130
It suits your level perfectly.

254
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:40,990
Is it the Boss's birthday?

255
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,620
Yes.

256
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,310
What?

257
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:03,280
It's right, today is my birthday.

258
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:08,200
Why didn't you ask her about the accident?

259
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,850
Hearing from Kang Yoo Jeong...

260
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:15,440
Wouldn't it be the most accurate answer?

261
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:19,390
Because she will not answer,

262
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:21,340
that Kang Yoo Jeong.

263
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,700
The most solid evidence is

264
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:30,010
from Ahn Do Hoon's mouth,

265
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:32,400
it would be listening directly from him.

266
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:38,000
What is more important than the board of directors' decision

267
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,770
is the decision of the Madam Min Hyeok will be meeting tomorrow.

268
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:43,190
The reason why Jo Min Hyeok changed tomorrow's schedule

269
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,590
is because of that person?

270
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:47,170
If that investment confirms,

271
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:50,900
rather than the sales that come with 
complicated procedures and full of rumors, the board

272
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,450
will hold up Min Hyeok's hand.

273
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,550
It's not a small amount of money.

274
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,840
Since she is not someone who moves small money,

275
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,060
Min Hyeok is personally going to see her.

276
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,470
All external contracts

277
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:07,630
cannot be acknowledged unless the Legal Team agrees.

278
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:12,100
The review of the investment contract, 
I will personally confirm it.

279
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,580
Kang Yoo Jeong will be accompanying Min Hyeok tomorrow.

280
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:23,930
Do Hoon, what you're capable of, 
I'll have high expectations for once.

281
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,060
<i>If...</i>

282
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:48,470
<i>Even if I had not driven,</i>

283
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,820
<i>I was still at that place.</i>

284
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,370
Crazy mother.

285
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,350
If Kang Yoo Jeong didn't drive,

286
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,400
what would he have done...

287
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:24,950
It's not my style to extend my hands to people and kneel.

288
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:27,240
I've never done it before.

289
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,380
So, you do a good job.

290
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,500
Oh, please come in.

291
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,100
You're here.

292
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:53,570
Thankfully, the legal team came first, and

293
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:56,690
I was briefed well on investment conditions.

294
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,610
Yes.

295
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:00,300
Please, sit.

296
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,930
This is the planning document.

297
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:15,850
You've got a great talent.

298
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:19,300
From Attorney Ahn, about the present situation,

299
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,160
I heard some unbiased helpful words.

300
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,630
Madam, you're investing quite a lot in the K-Group.

301
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:30,080
After we reveal the information we have,

302
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,720
is when you should make your choice, 
was what I was thinking. 

303
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,650
King's Restaurant,

304
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:38,540
what is the reason I should invest in it?

305
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,920
Just by looking at your face, President Jo,

306
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,400
I cannot offer this money, can I?

307
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:49,040
Can I use your kitchen for a moment?

308
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,650
Yes, you can.

309
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:06,900
I didn't prepare the main ingredient on purpose.

310
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,150
Our sauce at the King's Restaurant,

311
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:13,260
because of our pride that it goes well with any ingredient.

312
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,400
My father...

313
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:31,050
ran an old bakery in town.

314
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:36,270
Because I liked sweet things too much,

315
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:39,100
he made vegetable bread.

316
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,250
The vegetables I hated so much,

317
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,510
he made them with the sauce I really liked.

318
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,940
He has passed away now

319
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:51,690
but that taste remains with me as a good memory.

320
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:55,170
If you hear our brand King's Restaurant,

321
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:59,090
The distinct taste that people will remember is our value.

322
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,990
This isn't your personal business, Kang Yoo Jeong.

323
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:04,420
Please sell your memory somewhere else.

324
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:07,240
I am not here to sell a memory.

325
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,720
The sauce that we make...

326
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,780
We're confident that we'll be able to 
capture the customers' taste buds.

327
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,680
We need assuredness, not confidence.

328
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,380
As the major shareholder of King's, 
the position of K-Hotel is...

329
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,440
The president of the restaurant is me.

330
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:26,980
Aren't you here as an advisor for this investment contract, 
Attorney Ahn?

331
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:29,460
What I represent is

332
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,340
not the restaurant, but K-Group.

333
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,510
It has good enough palate.

334
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:45,120
It appears you can't trust each other 
amongst the K-Group family,

335
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,850
but to ask me to provide the funds?

336
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:49,870
Doesn't that seem a little far fetched?

337
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:53,640
I guess the rumor of Chairman being gravely ill is true.

338
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:57,540
Seeing how they sent out an incongruous team.

339
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,240
Shinha Hotel people are here.

340
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,950
I'm scheduled for another appointment.

341
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:07,540
I will contact you upon review.

342
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,590
Attorney Ahn.

343
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:31,230
If you break the rules like that, 
it makes me feel really bad.

344
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:39,060
I acted according to the Board of Directors' opinion.

345
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:42,170
I'm sorry if it made you feel bad.

346
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,880
Is that right?

347
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,690
Keep holding out like that,

348
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:49,950
until I go back up again.

349
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,810
Let's go.

350
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,090
Thank you

351
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:09,090
for making me feel disappointed in you, 
more and more.

352
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,140
I'm sorry.

353
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,310
Don't say sorry.

354
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,430
But, because of me.

355
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:41,230
It's not your fault.

356
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:43,350
Nothing has been decided yet.

357
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:45,590
Still...

358
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,560
Please!

359
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,580
Don't you know how to blame it on someone else?

360
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,110
It's the easiest way.

361
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:54,740
Just think of it like it was Ahn Do Hoon's fault, 
if anything goes wrong.

362
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,770
What is this?

363
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:18,820
It was your birthday.

364
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,800
It's Cream Bread.

365
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,760
We don't have an oven, so I baked it in the rice cooker.

366
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,540
The shape might not be appealing,
 but it's delicious.

367
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,680
I don't like sweet things.

368
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,050
Oh.

369
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:38,330
Then, would you like to have a meal before you go?

370
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:46,310
Drive safely.

371
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,300
I'll accept it since you gave it to me.

372
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:32,190
Omo, unbelievable President. It's been a long time.

373
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:37,080
You became even brighter! But behind you is...?
1+1?

374
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:40,120
Unni, is today some special occasion?

375
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:45,130
I started a new business.

376
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:48,350
It's magic. Herb oil.

377
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,880
If you have a few drops of this,

378
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,570
then your immunity level improves, your blood circulates well, and it is the best for your stamina.

379
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:57,190
Unni, Unni! If you sell that thing worth less than $1 for $20,
you're going back to jail!

380
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:03,170
Omo, omo. If you take this, the this potbelly filled with 
grease (fat) will get completely flat!

381
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:07,920
Would you like to become a partner in this miraculous business?

382
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:14,800
Unni, it's Boss's birthday, so I was going to ask him 
to have a meal with us.

383
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,040
President's birthday?

384
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:20,020
Really? Then, we have to honor him.

385
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:26,680
♫ Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you

386
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:34,070
♫ Dear President, Happy birthday to you!

387
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:45,310
- Come on! Come and join in on this meal all friendly like.
- Gwang Soo, you!

388
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:47,190
Please sit.

389
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:55,360
Gwang Soo, let's eat together.

390
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,250
You always stand like that, so hurry up and come.

391
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:01,420
That's right, let's eat. Eat.

392
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:11,140
New face, one plus one.
♫ What is your name? What's your phone number?

393
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,290
I'm Choi Gwang Soo.

394
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:16,040
Choi Gwang Soo, you have a nice name. Have some.

395
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:22,050
Drink first. Drink first.

396
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:23,330
Have a drink, have a drink!

397
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:26,130
It's alright, I'll call a substitute driver. Have some.

398
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:29,560
You won't be able to sleep at night and you know what
would be palpitating (herb oil's good for stamina she said!).

399
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:34,140
Gwang Soo...

400
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:41,310
Sing! Sing! Sing! 
 ♫ If you can't sing, you can't get married~ ♫ Ah, the person we hate~

401
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:46,440
♫ If it [song] doesn't come out then we'll go in for invasion,
♫ Bam-ba-da-bam-bam!

402
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:51,150
♫ 1 beat, rest and go, 2 beats, rest and go, 
♫ 3 beats, rest and go,♫ 1, 2, 3, 4!

403
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,010
Ah, until when do you--

404
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:55,620
♫ My love that looks towards you,

405
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:58,880
♫ is absolute, absolute it is.

406
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:06,310
♫ My love that looks towards you, is express speed love.

407
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,400
<i>♫ I love one person</i>

408
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:16,300
<i>♫ I That person is you</i>

409
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,300
<i>♫ Even though I cannot say</i>

410
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:23,200
<i>♫ Love or farewell</i>

411
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:27,200
<i>♫ In the world where there is none</i>

412
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:33,700
<i>♫ I want to meet once again</i>

413
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:37,780
<i>♫ My love</i>

414
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:01,760
<i>[Ahjumma (Hong In Joo)]</i>

415
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,560
It's me.

416
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,550
Did father

417
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:23,080
go into surgery?

418
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:34,370
If you don't have an appointment, you can't see her.

419
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,680
Then this. Please at least pass this.

420
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:42,250
I made it last week so it's perfect to eat this week, you know?

421
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:45,540
Please do me this favor.

422
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:57,430
President, I have found Lee Hae Jin.

423
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:59,250
Who?

424
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,750
Kang Yoo Jeong's cellmate from jail.

425
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,570
Why did she report Kang Yoo Jeong?

426
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:11,300
After she reported, thanks to the recommendation 
Ahn Do Hoon wrote, while he was a prosecutor,

427
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,500
she was transferred to a vocational training center.

428
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,480
What?

429
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,610
<i>Recommendation 
(Vocational Center Recommendation)</i>

430
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:19,790
<i>Seoul Central District Prosecutor Office
Posted by Prosecutor: Ahn Do Hoon</i>

431
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:26,910
This is the screen shot of parking lot CCTV 
that Ms. Lee Ja Yeong requested.

432
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,050
<i>Please, save me just this once!</i>

433
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:43,730
<i>I cannot send my father off like this.</i>

434
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,750
<i>They said they found my dad. 
- Where? </i>

435
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,610
<i>In Pohang.</i>

436
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:04,020
<i>Dad! Dad Dad!</i>

437
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:21,470
<i>I would like to be by your side.</i>

438
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:24,030
<i>Is it because of Ahn Do Hoon?</i>

439
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,800
Ahn Do Hoon!

440
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,900
It was Hannam-dong madam.

441
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:55,140
She said Min Hyeok came by again.

442
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:59,730
She is also curious 
as to what kind of person Kang Yoo Jeong is...

443
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,670
That woman must have done well.

444
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:06,840
She didn't seem like a person 
who would move big money on shallow emotion.

445
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,400
I can't know that.

446
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,430
She is not curious about you, Do Hoon.

447
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:24,390
Would you like to take one?

448
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:30,080
Are you really going to do it?

449
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:33,720
Why? Are you going to cling on to me or something?

450
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,270
What kind of relationship are we in?

451
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:43,320
Can you say you have a 
deeper relationship with Jo Min Hyeok?

452
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:46,780
Do you want to have me?

453
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:53,550
Then, that woman, get her off Min Hyeok.

454
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,560
Can you do that?

455
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:00,910
If I do that, can you come to me?

456
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:05,530
What should I do?

457
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:08,240
I do have to marry.

458
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:13,340
Would you be satisfied, 
even if you were my second?

459
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:56,000
Us two... Don't we really seem like fools?

460
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:15,300
Put your guard down.

461
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,190
I didn't call you for work.

462
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:20,530
If it wasn't for work, I wouldn't have come all the way here.

463
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:23,480
I'm behind on contracts I need to confirm.

464
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:27,650
I'll make it short, then.

465
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,760
Lee Hae Jin.

466
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:38,290
Kang Yoo Jeong's fellow inmate, 
who reported her for child abuse, right?

467
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,860
Why did you write the recommendation for her?

468
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,230
It is something that has nothing to do with you.

469
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:49,560
It has nothing to do with me. 
It's Kang Yoo Jeong that's the problem.

470
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,720
For someone whose first reaction is to close her mouth, 
as soon as you are mentioned,

471
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:57,310
why did she turn around like that? 
That's what I'm so intrigued about.

472
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:02,160
There is no secret in the world, right?

473
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,900
Just what is it that you want to say?

474
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:09,470
The prosecutor who was screaming 
for the justice of an era,

475
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:13,210
behind the scenes, secured his child... Wow.

476
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:17,110
Attorney Ahn, you and I...

477
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:20,680
What I said that we're not different, 
I would like to take that back.

478
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:25,140
Because I don't think I can become 
such an insidious character.

479
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:30,600
Did Kang Yoo Jeong turn around knowing this, or

480
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,260
did you pull some other crap that is huge?

481
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,030
Wasn't the parole

482
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,950
a plan that you came up with, Jo Min Hyeok?

483
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:41,570
You should say what is right. 
It was you who made the choice, Attorney Ahn.

484
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:43,530
Jo Min Hyeok!

485
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:48,660
The person who put the red flag on the parole document 
is not me, but yourself.

486
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:51,560
For me it was simply, 
for the sentencing you gave,

487
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:54,900
I wanted Kang Yoo Jeong to serve out the term 
in the correctional facility. Of course,

488
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:59,260
I absolutely regret that now, but...

489
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:02,950
Regarding the red flag on Kang Yoo Jeong's parole,

490
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:06,470
before the evaluation result even came out,

491
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:10,320
it had gotten disapproval 
due to insufficient qualifications.

492
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:15,870
So, is it because putting the red flag 
on the parole evaluation bothered you, that you did such a thing?

493
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,320
So as not to let your fault surface, 
you used a hired hand

494
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,090
to make the parole itself negated?

495
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,670
<i>Take him away.</i>

496
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:30,990
<i>San... Not now.</i>

497
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,870
<i>San, San, San, San!</i>

498
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:37,380
<i>San. Let go, let go.</i>

499
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:42,570
That's a little cowardly.

500
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:46,530
Isn't Kang Yoo Jeong too pitiful?

501
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,910
What are you so righteous about?

502
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,320
Not having been able to protect our women,

503
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,050
is the same for both of us.

504
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,320
Ji Hee!

505
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,680
That's right...

506
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:15,850
You have to come on strong like that.

507
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,890
That has to be... so that the secrets you have,

508
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:22,890
it will be fun peeling them off one by one.

509
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:40,260
Matters regarding Kang Yoo Jeong's father,

510
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:44,610
I'll think about that slowly.

511
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,030
What's going on? You didn't even call.

512
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:05,440
Officetels or places like that are nice, 
although they are claustrophobic, right?

513
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:12,610
Aigoo, but, your face doesn't look so good. 
Is something wrong?

514
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:17,550
No...

515
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:18,620
Where's mother?

516
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:23,670
She said she had an appointment in the daytime
and left the store today. She's not back yet.

517
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:28,220
Don't worry about the house.

518
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:32,510
I barely settled your mother down about moving. 
She was making such a fuss.

519
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:36,860
It's empty here too, now that you're gone.

520
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:39,290
What's the point of moving to a bigger one?

521
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:42,970
It's old and the hill is steep 
 so it's difficult for you, father.

522
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:44,540
Just move to a comfortable area.

523
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:45,840
No,

524
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,000
I don't want to ask anyone a favor.

525
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,310
It's enough to be called boss at my own store.

526
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:53,450
What more can I ask for?

527
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:56,870
Why?

528
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,270
Father.

529
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:06,070
I'm living a good life, right?

530
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,960
Why is the front door opened?!

531
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,870
Hon- 
 Oh you scared me!

532
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:16,360
Why are you surprised seeing your own son?! 
 - Hey...!

533
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,890
Hey... hey... hey...

534
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,040
No that's not it,

535
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:23,000
You should have called us before you came!

536
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,840
Then what about you...
 How come you're so late without telling me where you were!

537
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,820
I mean...

538
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:31,620
Over there...

539
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,500
I mean...

540
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,970
I'm going to go change.

541
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:43,090
What's wrong with her?

542
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:51,220
Did you eat?

543
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:54,550
Is there something in the storage?

544
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:56,920
What's wrong with you today?

545
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,440
So strange.

546
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,150

547
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:08,220
Hello! We're from King's Restaurant!

548
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,670
You came!

549
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:15,380
I'm the one who called.

550
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:19,410
Since I didn't host Min Hyeok's birthday party, 
I thought better late than not.

551
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:20,820
I see.

552
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,920
Please start setting on the table over there.

553
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,350
And prepare the food over there.

554
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:29,010
One person should suffice, so you all can go.

555
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:31,490
Is that okay?

556
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:32,630
Pardon?

557
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,880
Yes.

558
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:45,540
Min Hyeok.

559
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:48,090
Min Hyeok?

560
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,360
Yeah?

561
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,760
The Chairman moved to the recovery room yesterday.

562
00:45:57,150 --> 00:45:58,210
Post op progress?

563
00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:01,500
We have to wait and see, but he'll recover.

564
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:06,320
Before he returns, he'll be attending a meeting in Berlin.

565
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:10,140
It'll be a good opportunity 
to show the public that he is healthy.

566
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,580
I heard about the investment.

567
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:17,130
You did well.

568
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:21,230
She was asking about the employee who accompanied you,

569
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,120
is it the woman, you said before, 
who worried you?

570
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,070
I will take care of my own business.

571
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:29,020
I don't want to meddle with your personal life, either.

572
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:32,820
Should your marriage with Shin Se Yeon go wrong, 
what'll happen,

573
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:36,250
you should know better than anyone.

574
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:42,710
Attorney Ahn's file...

575
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:45,860
Why haven't I seen it yet?

576
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:49,150
The incidents you incurred, 
he did a good job cleaning them up, and

577
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:52,360
Except for running around due to the board's decision,

578
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:55,050
like the Chairman said, he is an elite K-Group needs.

579
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:58,780
We should use him as long as he is useful, 
the impediment

580
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:00,840
is Se Yeon.

581
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,510
Attorney Ahn and Se Yeon,

582
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:06,220
it'll be good to keep an eye on them.

583
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,930
Min Hyeok-ssi is quite late, isn't he?

584
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:32,900
Min Hyeok-ssi! Happy Birthday!

585
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:37,740
What is this... We didn't know 
you would settle down with one woman.

586
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:40,770
As expected, Shi Se Yeon must be exceptional.

587
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:43,170
Happy Birthday Min Hyeok-ssi

588
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:51,480
I didn't even get to congratulate you 
 on your birthday.

589
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,210
Want to have a glass?

590
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:57,220
Please bring some wine here.

591
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:06,970
Why are you here?

592
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,340
What's all this?

593
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:24,830
What are you trying to do?

594
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:26,570
I told you.

595
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:31,250
Congratulate you on your birthday, 
congratulate you on getting the investment as well.

596
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:33,780
Our marriage also,

597
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,930
congratulate in advance. 
- Shin Se Yeon!

598
00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:38,580
We're in front of my friends.

599
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:42,230
Please mind your manners.

600
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:48,230
Please clean this up, here.

601
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,040

602
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:07,140
One moment please.

603
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:20,440
Could you bring us some coffee here?

604
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,530
Yes.

605
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,920
I'm sorry.

606
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:52,810
Yes?

607
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:54,940
You've worked hard.

608
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:58,300
The diligence that you sent from the morning,

609
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:02,620
The Hannam-dong granny,

610
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,560
I think she changed her mind.

611
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:11,710
Really?

612
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:20,530
What a relief! Really, what a relief.

613
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:23,190
What is it?

614
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:33,900
Is the coffee far from being done?

615
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,460
Yes, it's done.

616
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,960
Move.

617
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:45,470
I'll clean it up.
- I said go.

618
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:48,110
Go, because it's hot.

619
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:02,700
Since I've sent away my friends,

620
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:05,340
we four should cozily have a drink.

621
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:07,500
We four?

622
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:29,370
Bring the desserts please.

623
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:47,260
Didn't you enjoy this kind of thing?

624
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:50,350
Everyone knows, but pretending not to.

625
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:51,320
Se Yeon...

626
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,480
How about you, Yoo Jeong?

627
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:58,060
The man you've dated in the past,

628
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:02,330
the man who tortures you in the worst way.

629
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:07,550
Who are you more uncomfortable with?

630
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:09,470
You don't need to answer.

631
00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:12,050
She shouldn't have any feelings for me.

632
00:52:12,050 --> 00:52:19,230
"Let's not feel sorry for each other anymore.", 
she told me on the day she gave me the ultimatum.

633
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:25,080
Why? Do you have something to say?

634
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:28,050
I'm sorry...

635
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,160
But,

636
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:35,740
you two look vulnerable.

637
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:45,260
You two look suitable to each other.

638
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,360
Since I don't seem to be needed anymore, 
I'll get going.

639
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:59,590
Rest of the kitchenware, I'll come back tomorrow for them.

640
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:12,190
How was it? Didn't you like this kind of thing?

641
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:14,880
It's my present. Did you like it?

642
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:15,870
Is it fun?

643
00:53:15,870 --> 00:53:20,040
Setting up something like this for fun, 
wasn't it a hobby of yours, Jo Min Hyeok?

644
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:26,270
I must have told you not to cut in, 
when I'm talking to Se Yeon.

645
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:38,510
The present I prepared for you, 
I should be able to send it to you soon.

646
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:41,920
Attorney Ahn, you know something?

647
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:48,550
There is no one who is really strong, 
who pretends to be strong.

648
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:53,910
Attorney Ahn, 
you look very much susceptible to danger now.

649
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:59,950
For your congratulations,

650
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:04,350
thank you.

651
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:35,670
Get in.

652
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:37,350
I'll take the bus.

653
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:38,890
Get in!

654
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:44,460
You said you'd do what I tell you, 
get in.

655
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:49,650
I know Min Hyeok.

656
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:54,310
I've watched him since kindergarten.

657
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:02,300
If only Seo Ji Hee died, 
I thought I could have him, but...

658
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:19,320
The way Min Hyeok looks at that woman,

659
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:24,700
it's love.

660
00:55:55,880 --> 00:56:01,370
Thank you for giving me a ride, boss.

661
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:43,270
<i>♫ A person came into my life</i>

662
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:49,780
<i>♫ The person I should not love</i>

663
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:57,130

667
00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:30,490
