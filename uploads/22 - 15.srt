Shin Ah Foundation,

93
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,540
don't touch it.

94
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:06,150
You're the one who made the choice.

If something goes wrong with Se Yeon,

96

And of course, the K-Group,

98
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,100
you'll regret it.

99
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,220
Regret? I won't.

100
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,800
In order for me to survive, stopping Yoo Jeong from
doing something she should...

101
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:29,270
That's what should be more regrettable.

102
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,560
Before being Kang Yoo Jeong's man,

103
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,400
you're the K-Group's heir.

104
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,350
That the K-Group is vulnerable,

105
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,340

106
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,560

112
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:45,440

174
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,560
"It will all turn out all right," say it.

175
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,630
It will turn out all right.

176
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,780
That's right.

177
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:24,540
Since you said, "it will turn out all right," it will all turn
 out fine.

178
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,320
What's happened?

179
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:26,280
My father came and went.

180
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:31,030
My father,

181
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:34,420
his reputation to others is important,

182
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,650
so don't start rumors about this.

183
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,430
Shin Hwa Foundation's materials haven't been turned over yet.

184
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,200
Only the ones that they were already investigating.

185
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,150
It doesn't matter.

186
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,540
Look at the state you're in. It does matter!

187
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,180
We can stop even now.

188
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,810
If we stop...

189
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,930
Along with me...

190
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,340
Can you leave with me?

191
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,910
You said that you wanted to leave?

192
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,420
Let's go.

193
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,820
While you do the things that you want to do.

194
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,760
Without any thought.

195
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,280
Thank you.

196
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,090
Because of you, Do Hoon,

197
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,120
I really am going to marry Min Hyeok.

198
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:17,960
The Chairman who wanted to be released, I only barely was able to convince him otherwise.

199
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:22,290
Tomorrow go back to find the Chairman and tell him that you'll continue with the wedding.

200
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,140
Please leave.

201
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,580
Turning your back to your father, how much harder to you want to make things?

202
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,950
I told you to get out!

203
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:30,690
After you sent your mother (after she died), the you that was suffering and in pain,

204
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,580
I held and raised you.

205
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:36,020
Are you going to also send your father and live your whole life regretting? Over that kind of a woman?

206
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:39,380
Over a woman like you, even Father...

207
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,630
He threw away my mother.

208
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,450
You.

209
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,150
Are you acting like this because you really don't know,

210
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,440
or are you pretending not to know?

211
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,800
My coming into this house was by your mom's request.

212
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:05,520
The me who was only a native singer on the stage, it's true that the Chairman saw me nicely,

213
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,850
but it was only to there.

214
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:09,720
Even you know,

215
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,230
that Madam (Min Hyeok's mom) was having a hard time psychologically.

216
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:16,200
"Living as K Group's Madam, I can't do it anymore,"

217
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,660
the person that requesting you and the Chairman,

218
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,580
was your mother.

219
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:25,480
What? That doesn't even make any sense!
- Fine.

220
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,550
Don't believe it.

221
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,900
That there is even love like that that doesn't make sense,

222
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:42,190
tell the Chairman with your own mouth.

223
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,930
He doesn't listen to my words anymore.

224
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:13,060
The President asked for me to escort you.

225
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,990
Thank you.

226
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:21,970
The President has a lot of work to do today.

227
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,710
Yes.

228
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,610
Let's go.

229
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,450
That day, it's true that I gave Kang Woo Cheol a ride.

230
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:38,130
While I had momentarily parked my car in front of a 
store he disappeared.

231
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,770
His Medic Alert bracelet disappeared.

232
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:43,870
What that bracelet means, there aren't a lot of people
 who know.

233
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:46,190
The person who put that bracelet on

234
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:48,120
will have had some reason to take it off.

235
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,290
Leaving a father that had no directional sense 
due to dementia,

236
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:54,350
Kang Yoo Jeong was drinking alcohol at a club.

237
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:58,850
That she had lost her father, I was only notified later. I only received her request, and

238
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,890
I only went to find him.

239
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:05,040
That night the store owner who saw my father said this.

240
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,150
As for that day, he was fine.

241
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,830
That he even recognized people.

242
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,030
What did my father say, who had regained his senses,

243
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:16,560
that it was worth putting him out onto the street?

244
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,920
Where you that afraid of him?

245
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,280
It's the start now.

246
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:37,200
That day, what had happened to my father,

247
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,160
you're going to have to tell me everything.

248
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,730
No matter how hard you try to kick your feet, there's nothing that you can prove.

249
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:43,800
It's a waste of time.

250
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,170
Even if it takes my whole life I'm going to make it happen.

251
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,650
You're wrongs with your own mouth.

252
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:53,110
Do you know how people who have nothing delude themselves?

253
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:56,470
You believe that there are things like truth and pity.

254
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:59,300
Don't be deluded. There aren't any such things.

255
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,500
Do you still not know?

256
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:07,000
Love or righteousness, strong people are the ones 
who can protect those things.

257
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,050
That's why it turned out like this for us.

258
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,880
How did you turn out like this?

259
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:26,650
Hey, I'm not the only one who likes the shows.

260
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:29,000
I couldn't beat you.

261
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,130
Have you decided to be the defender of righteousness?

262
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,800
Or, have you become an informant 
who betrayed the organization?

263
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,050
What are you talking about?

264
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:45,710
People were talking. It's also all over the news.

265
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,450
I told you, right? Min Hyeok is not such as easy person.

266
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,550
Whose side are you on, Sunbaenim?

267
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,800
It's Jo Min Hyeok who did wrong, not me.

268
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:00,450
If Min Hyeok did wrong, he should be punished.

269
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:03,710
But, it's not in my jurisdiction yet.

270
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,970
That woman just now,

271
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:10,920
she is that hit-and-run perpetrator, right?

272
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:16,450
Once my special prosecutions duties are over, 
I'm going to ask the chief, and

273
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:19,500
I'll have to take your case.

274
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:29,950
<i>Attorney Ahn Do Hoon who exposed K-Group's 
wrongdoings, from the paper company that K-Group established in Hong Kong,</i>

275
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:33,470
<i>there is a suspicion that he embezzled $6.5 mil.</i>

276
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:39,710
<i>President Jo Min Hyeok who has become known 
as K-Group's heir, at the interviews with the reporters today...</i>

277
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,250
Have you been here?

278
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,500
It's high, eh?

279
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,380
It's perfect height for falling, too.

280
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,800
$6.5mil,

281
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:02,090
instead of my pocket, 
it's money that went into your building.

282
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,880
Right.

283
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,850
But, there is no evidence.

284
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:11,460
Hyung is quite meticulous. He doesn't leave evidence.

285
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,840
And that two, it resembles you, Ahn Do Hoon.

286
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,210
Congratulations on your marriage.

287
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,150
Assemblyman Shin has even hit Se Yeon.

288
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:25,820
The person who made Se Yeon hurt like that

289
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,420
is none other than you.

290
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,000
I have nothing more to lose anyway.

291
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:33,460
Yoo Jeong told me

292
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:37,590
that the person who has more is supposed to worry more.

293
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:43,250
Jo Min Hyeok, don't you have more than me?

294
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,430
I wanted to take it away from you, but it's beyond me.

295
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,070
So, I want to lose together.

296
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:53,620
I have no intention of going with you, Attorney Ahn Do Hoon.

297
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:56,950
I'll admit to the $6.5 mil embezzlement, but for that

298
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:00,550
K-Group and Shin Ah Foundation, let's go down together.

299
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:05,500
Let the Chairman see the penitentiary, 
then you, Se Yeon and even Assemblyman Shin,

300
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:10,140
would be busy going in and out of the Prosecutions Office.

301
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,970
To crumble because of you alone, Attorney Ahn,

302
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,730
our company is not that mediocre.

303
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:16,550
It's not just me.

304
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:21,690
People who got fed up with the actions 
the Chaebols have been taking, I'll be with them.

305
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:24,090
So, what would you expect will change?

306
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:28,190
I thought you were smart, but

307
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,590
you're quite an idealist.

308
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,960
On the day of Seo Ji Hee's accident,

309
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,460
it wasn't Yoo Jeong, but

310
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,250
it was me who drove.

311
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:52,090
Would you like to record or something?

312
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:53,950
Or,

313
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,300
should I say it again?

314
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,630
It wasn't Yoo Jeong,

315
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,590
but it was me who killed her.

316
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,750
Yoo Jeong told me she would go to jail in my place.

317
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,650
I tried to discourage her, but it didn't work.

318
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:15,890
Ahn Do Hoon...

319
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:17,710
She's that kind of girl.

320
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,500
For such worthless love, 
the person who would even give up her own life.

321
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:24,800
The file,

322
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,920
recording.

323
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,090
Do as you wish.

324
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:34,710
But I'm curious.

325
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,250
Your woman whom I could not protect,

326
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,510
if you can protect her with those things.

327
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:43,970
Don't touch Yoo Jeong.

328
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,710
I won't touch her.

329
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,460
As low as you fall,

330
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:52,670
because she'll be ruining herself.

331
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:01,500
Pitiful bastard.

332
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,740
What it is that you've lost, do you still not know?

333
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:20,170
Even though for once, you whom Kang Yoo Jeong loved,

334
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,920
I hoped, were not this kind of worthless human being.

335
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,890
Father.

336
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,050
Father!

337
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,870
It's dangerous for you to go, why are you being like this?

338
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:01,530
Then, lying down like this,

339
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,700
are you saying I should just keep watching you 
take the company to the ground, boy?

340
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,300
Huh?

341
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,130
Father..

342
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,590
Father.

343
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,550
Alright.

344
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,750
since I abused it for over 60 years,

345
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:30,510
my body breaking down is rather normal.

346
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,090
I...

347
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:39,460
made as much money as I wanted, but

348
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,750
always,

349
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:45,530
I bowed to the power.

350
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:49,430
There is only one thing I want from you.

351
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:51,050
The power,

352
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,170
that you stand above it.

353
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,650
That's why

354
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:59,940
we need Assemblyman Shin, boy.

355
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,960
I'm not that great a punk, you know that well.

356
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,460
What I want to protect is

357
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,250
that woman.

358
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,250
Love?

359
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,300
It's good.

360
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:21,090
But,

361
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:24,130
as you go on living, it changes.

362
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,550
After time passes, all gets forgotten.

363
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,920
Your mom...

364
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,450
With a father who was addicted to gambling,

365
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:43,210
she was a daughter of an inn.

366
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:47,280
I brought her in for the debt, kept her by my side, and

367
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,610
built a small hotel for her.

368
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:54,660
That was the beginning of K-Hotel.

369
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:58,960
We were having an opening ceremony, and

370
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,090
she smiled brightly.

371
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,250
For me,

372
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,710
seeing her smile,

373
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:11,170
that was the last time.

374
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:15,750
Father!

375
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:18,090
Because of you, one person,

376
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:22,130
K-Hotel shaking,

377
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,630
I cannot allow that.

378
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:28,590
Not a desire as your father,

379
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:32,370
but as a person responsible for the company,

380
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:35,670
I'm asking you.

381
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,550
K-Hotel,

382
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,210
in place of me,

383
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,630
you protect it.

384
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:48,220
So that the cross that Gwang Min beared

385
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,800
was not done in vain.

386
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:57,500
I'm asking you.

387
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,340
I told you I would see you again.

388
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,920
Can you see?

389
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,960
The house is empty.

390
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:19,850
My daughter,

391
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:23,000
I sent her abroad, so that she doesn't freak out.

392
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,500
You saw the news, right?

393
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:31,320
If the marriage with Se Yeon breaks, 
the company will become harder.

394
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,470
then, Min Hyeok won't be safe, either.

395
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:36,070
Investigations, trials, penitentiary!

396
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:39,460
Are you going to turn a person you love into a criminal, 
like you?

397
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:44,220
Is that the way you love Min Hyeok?

398
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,330
Madam!

399
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,920
The Chairman

400
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,710
is in bad health.

401
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:53,750
If Min Hyeok also leaves, abandoning the company, 
I guess it would become harder.

402
00:29:56,450 --> 00:30:01,300
Min Hyeok, he is not someone who can abandon his father, 
and continue to be happy with you.

403
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,900
You know that, right?

404
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,170
Do I need to speak more?

405
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,200
The boss...

406
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,600
He expresses more frustration when he is happy, and

407
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,300
when he is thankful, he expresses anger for no reason.

408
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,600
But...

409
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,490
When he is hurt, he doesn't show it.

410
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:44,430
He seems to be having a hard time because of his deceased mother.

411
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,600
Now...

412
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:50,550
You're his mother, right?

413
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,480
The boss,

414
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,900
I ask you to take care of him.

415
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
It's me.

416
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:28,580
Do you have time tomorrow?

417
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,800
Was the place you wanted to go with me,

418
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,800
here?

419
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,800
My dad...

420
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,900
I couldn't be by his side when he passed away.

421
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,500
How lonely he must have been,

422
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,800
when I think about it,

423
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,100
it hurts me a lot.

424
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,690
Because of the person I loved,

425
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,000
because of my desire,

426
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:12,530
I know because I have abandoned him.

427
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,000
How thoroughly regretful that is,

428
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,700
I know. 
- Yoo Jeong?

429
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,000
So, how can I

430
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,700
tell you to abandon your father? 
- Don't say.

431
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,600
Don't say anything.

432
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,000
Look at you even now.

433
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,080
You can't even say anything, 
although it's hard for you.

434
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:04,590
It's not something you should worry about.

435
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,200
I've been to the restaurant.

436
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:09,540
Everyone is worried because 
something might happen to the company.

437
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,520
Letting go of the company because of me,

438
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:16,510
to all those working employees believing in you,

439
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,390
it's a thing that you're sinning.

440
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,900
I can't tell you to do that.

441
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,300
I don't... want to live feeling sorry to people anymore.

442
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,100
What do they have to do with me?

443
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,300
I'm not that great of an ass!

444
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,400
It's hard enough just trying to protect my woman.

445
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:36,290
I don't like it. I said I don't like it!

446
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,900
I told you all I need is you by my side!

447
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,300
You... Don't say useless things.

448
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,900
Aish! I'm so annoyed!

449
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,300
I'm behind on interviews.

450
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,900
I'll make it short.

451
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,400
Gwang Soo.

452
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,700
The file and the recording,

453
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,330
destroy them.

454
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,300
Yoo Jeong?

455
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:55,340
Let's have fun with me.

456
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,400
Are you telling me to skip work?

457
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,800
Just today.

458
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,500
Then...

459
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,210
Just today.

460
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:13,150
Let's have fun just for today.

461
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:18,300
<i>♫ For me to have</i>

462
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,400
<i>♫ The person too precious</i>

463
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:27,900
<i>♫ I dare love that person</i>

464
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:34,000
<i>♫ To a bad guy like me</i>

465
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,400
<i>♫ Who is not suitable</i>

466
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:41,400
<i>♫ I love one person</i>

467
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:45,900
<i>♫ That person is you</i>

468
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,900
<i>♫ Even though I cannot say</i>

469
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,900
<i>♫ Hot enough to get burned</i>

470
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:56,600
<i>♫ The tears in my heart</i>

471
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:01,100
<i>♫ If I can pour it out to you</i>

472
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,600
What did you scatter like that?

473
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,900
It's a secret.

474
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,000
<i>♫ In the world where there is none</i>

475
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:17,370
<i>♫ I want to meet once again</i>

476
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:21,280
<i>♫ Hot enough to get burned</i>

477
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:24,810
<i>♫ The tears in my heart</i>

478
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:29,790
<i>♫ If I can pour it out to you</i>

479
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,320
<i>♫ My love</i>

480
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:35,150
<i>♫ Love or farewell</i>

481
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:38,670
<i>♫ In the world where there is none</i>

482
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:44,970
<i>♫ I want to meet once again</i>

483
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,340
<i>♫ My love</i>

484
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,500
Dduckboki again? You know I can't eat spicy food.

485
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,800
Please try it.

486
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,700
Ah!

487
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,100
Oh, it's not spicy!

488
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,300
It tastes good.

489
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,200
I did a good job picking a right employee.

490
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,400
Forget about all worrisome things, and

491
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,600
should we live together at a place like this?

492
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,230
Should we?

493
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,500
Don't make a face like that.

494
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,800
Please smile!

495
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,200
Please leave it as a good memory today.

496
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,350
Boss...

497
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:50,380
Aren't we going back?

498
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:55,220
Yes, we should go back.

499
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,300
We

500
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,200
must have come too far.

501
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,800
It would be hard to go back.

502
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,100
But, I...

503
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,400
wish my whole life

504
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:15,700
was today.

505
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:21,500
Then, it wouldn't be fun.

506
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:26,060
Then...

507
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:30,930
Just until tomorrow, let's call it today.

508
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,820
Just until tomorrow.

509
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:10,400
<i>♫ Like a fool, I</i>

510
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,550
<i>♫ Like a fool like this</i>

511
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:21,920
<i>♫ Laugh laugh then cry again</i>

512
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:28,260
<i>♫ How could our love hurt so much like this</i>

513
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:35,750
<i>♫ Laugh laugh then cry again</i>

514
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:42,660
<i>♫ If the wind blew and swallowed my body</i>

515
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:51,150
<i>♫ Even if there were nothing, 
I cannot live without you</i>

516
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:54,750
<i>♫ That I love you crazily</i>

517
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:58,500
<i>♫ That I miss you crazily</i>

518
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,260
<i>♫ As if my heart would explode</i>

519
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:05,930
<i>♫ That it's a love like a storm</i>

520
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:09,510
<i>♫ Only as far as I would let</i>

521
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:13,220
<i>♫ That it can be away</i>

522
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:17,070
<i>♫ Unstoppable by anyone</i>

523
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:24,590
<i>♫ My love which is like the fool is saying</i>

524
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:31,510
<i>♫ From your behind</i>

525
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:34,750
<i>♫ Holding you in my arms</i>

526
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:41,710
<i>♫ Cry cry again I cry</i>

527
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:45,350
<i>♫ If the wind blew</i>

528
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:49,100
<i>♫ And swallowed my body</i>

529
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:57,300
<i>♫ Even if there were nothing, 
I cannot live without you</i>

530
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:00,250
Can a person

531
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:03,950
live without love,

532
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:05,330
is it possible?

533
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:08,780
<i>♫ As if my heart would explode</i>

534
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:12,550
<i>♫ That it's a love like the storm</i>

535
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:16,210
<i>♫ Only as far as I would let</i>

536
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:19,840
<i>♫ That it can be away</i>

537
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:23,490
<i>♫ Unstoppable by anyone</i>

538
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:28,660
<i>♫ My love which is like the fool</i>

539
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:32,670
<i>♫ Is calling you</i>

540
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,590
Instead of answering, the grandfather

541
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:43,300
kept on drinking the peppermint tea, 
which was supposed to be good for your health.

542
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:49,700
More.

543
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,570
It's up to here.

544
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:03,200
What did the old man say?

545
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,380
Is that all?

546
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:07,610
If you're curious,

547
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:10,800
after I leave,

548
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,390
please read it then.

549
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:15,030
I don't want to.

550
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:18,500
Read more before you go.

551
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:26,630
Because I have to look at the book, 
I can't see your face.

552
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,210
For now, like this...

553
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:39,670
please let's stay like this just a little more.

554
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:04,800
<i>What the grandfather said before he went senile</i>

555
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,880
<i>seems to be right.</i>

556
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:16,050
<i>A human being,</i>

557
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:20,050
<i>without a person to love,</i>

558
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:24,130
<i>cannot live.</i>

559
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:30,500
<i>♫ A person came into my life</i>

560
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:36,880
<i>♫ The person I should not love</i>

561
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:44,320
<i>♫ No I should not, no I should not</i>

562
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:49,550
<i>♫ I tried to turn away many times</i>

563
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:52,340
I should love?

564
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:56,920
How?

565
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:04,300
Yoo Jeong,

566
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,630
this kind of thing is love?

567
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:16,680
When it hurts this much...

568
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:20,400
It hurts so much that I feel like I would go crazy.

569
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,300
This kind of thing is love?

570
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:29,110
It's love, is right.

571
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:32,120
When you think about that someone,

572
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:38,990
that it hurts, that it distresses you, is also love.

573
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:45,330
<i>♫ Even though I say I'm hurt as if I could die</i>

574
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:50,590
<i>♫ I only watch</i>

575
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:53,150
<i>For me,</i>

576
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:56,440
<i>boss, you...</i>

577
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:00,170
<i>Min Hyeok, you...</i>

578
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:04,120
<i>so much,</i>

579
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,620
<i>hurt me.</i>

580
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:09,600
<i>♫ I believe that I love you</i>

581
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:13,800
<i>♫ If this limping love of mine</i>

582
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:20,590
<i>♫ If it moves near, because you might hide from fear</i>

583
00:47:20,590 --> 00:47:26,500
<i>♫ Even though I say I'm hurt as if I could die</i>

584
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:30,920
<i>♫ I only watch</i>

585
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:34,100
<i>RET</i>

586
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:39,700
<i>SECRET</i>

587
00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:00,000
You haven't eaten yet, right?

588
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:09,340
Unni,

589
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,240
now, I

590
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,800
did the right thing, right?

591
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:21,960
Right?

592
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:26,420
Liking that person

593
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:30,300
doesn't make sense, right?

594
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:35,420
It's what should not be,

595
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:39,250
right?

596
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:43,790
That's why

597
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:48,340
for me, now

598
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:52,670
letting him go

599
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:56,960
is right,

600
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,950
huh?

601
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:01,220
Right.

602
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:04,800
What you're doing is all right.

603
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:12,280
Is it really right?

604
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,920
But, why do the tears keep coming out?

605
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:34,550
Not shedding any tears when you let a person go,

606
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:37,110
that would be more strange.

607
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:44,460
This dress...

608
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:47,250
Just shred it.

609
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:18,800
Have you any knowledge re $65M embezzlement?

610
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,610
We don't know anything about that.

611
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:22,900
All we know is that our son is doing a good deed.

612
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:25,150
Mother, where is Attorney Ahn Do Hoon?

613
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:27,700
Please. Just leave. Please!

614
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:29,990
- Just say something...
- No, we don't know anything.

615
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:32,450
Excuse me!

616
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:35,340
Ah, man. Seriously...

617
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,930
What is this all about?

618
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:06,300
I guess you really made Min Hyeok and that woman to split up.

619
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:09,230
Thank you.

620
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:12,460
Will you be...

621
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:14,100
satisfied with this?

622
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:16,600
I told you.

623
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:20,210
I must possess him, at least once.

624
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:46,420
Ms. Kang Yoo Jeong.

625
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:51,800
The business is booming thanks to you, Ms. Yoo Jeong.

626
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:52,990
It's regretful.

627
00:52:52,990 --> 00:52:57,310
I'm thankful to you for the time I've spent here.

628
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:14,050
<i>Still unwavering royal family.
Expected guests alone will surpass several thousands.</i>

629
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:37,020
Yoo Jeong. Let's talk outside.

630
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:40,250
Why do I have to go outside?

631
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,780
Do Hoon Oppa will be here soon.

632
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:47,260
Get out. I'm saying to get out since there are customers.

633
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:50,240
Why? Are you worried that something will go wrong
with your attorney son?!

634
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:53,240
Listen to her. Seriously.

635
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,280
Then what about my dad?

636
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,860
What about my dad whose legs were both blistered from 
wandering around the streets,

637
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:00,900
thanks to your amazing attorney son abandoning him?

638
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:03,300
Where do you get off talking about stuff that didn't even
happe...

639
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:06,250
You take her out of here. Our business is going to fail!

640
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:10,300
How can a thing that happened become non-existent?

641
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:13,770
Then make my dad come back to life!

642
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:17,120
Yoo Jeong, let's go outside and talk, please?

643
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,300
You can't believe it, can you?

644
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:24,970
That's right. I couldn't believe it either at first.

645
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:28,650
But, Mother, no

646
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:32,800
you used to extremely hate me calling you Mother, didn't you?

647
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,420
Ajummoni.

648
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:40,900
That's why I came to hear directly from Oppa's mouth.

649
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:44,960
Come. Come this way.

650
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:52,900
I heard you went to a tour office? Cancel the honeymoon
as I have no intention of going.

651
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:55,780
Se Yeon.

652
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:59,050
Is this fun for you?

653
00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:01,020
I don't find this fun.

654
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:04,700
We didn't wed to have fun.

655
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:08,380
I have to change my clothes. Can you step outside, please?

656
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:11,960
Okay. Rest.

657
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:28,100
Even the married couple finishes when they divorce,
why act as if having been together for few years is a big deal?

658
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:32,170
Where do you get off trying to block the future
of someone's son?

659
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:34,500
Are you doing this as if killing someone itself was not enough?

660
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:37,360
Stop! Bringing out the past things!

661
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:41,250
How can killing someone become a "past thing"?

662
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:48,090
As you say. I'm sure killing someone doesn't become

663
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:49,850
a "past thing" because the time passes by.

664
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:51,640
The person who knows carries on like this here?

665
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,900
Do you still want to believe it that way?!

666
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:56,630
What? Don't say you didn't know.

667
00:55:56,630 --> 00:56:02,550
That car was only titled as mine, but driving was done
by Oppa, always.

668
00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:05,100
You remember the day after the accident.

669
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:07,880
I went to pick up the key [from him].

670
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:08,990
Wha-t are you saying?

671
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:11,530
You didn't understand?

672
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:15,210
Should I tell those people?

673
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:19,830
I let things slide and took into consideration thinking
what poor thing you are.

674
00:56:19,830 --> 00:56:24,300
Where do you think this is to come and cause this ruckus!
You're gross. Grotesque!

675
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:27,700
I am grotesque?

676
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:32,380
Gee, I wonder how grotesque it is to kill someone in
a hit-and-run,

677
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:35,210
and make my dad pass away by abandoning?

678
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:37,920
How long do you suppose he'll be incarcerated?

679
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,460
I bet he'd stay in longer, won't he?

680
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:43,990
- Are you crazy?
- No.

681
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:51,170
I am more normal [clear minded] now then any other time.

682
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,040
What are you afraid of?

683
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,380
If this isn't true, then tell those people [journalists].

684
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:56,960
Won't you stop!

685
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,950
Why do I have to stop?

686
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:04,220
Everyone, I have something to say about

687
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:07,590
that amazing Attorney Ahn Do Hoon!
- Attorney Ahn! Have you something to say to the press?

688
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:10,030
Please take it outside.

689
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:12,150
You little wench!

690
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:16,390
Stop it. Stop it, I say!

691
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:18,840
Calm down, I say!

692
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:21,120
Why?!

693
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:28,710
San...

694
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:38,800
San... Aren't you going to see him?

695
00:57:42,050 --> 00:57:49,420
San... Your son... Don't you want to see him?
