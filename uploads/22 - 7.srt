00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,710
Accumulated fatigue... and 
she doesn't seem to have been eating right, either.

3
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,200
Symptoms of exhaustion are serious.

4
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,800
For now, she is stable.

<i>♫ Even though I reach out my hand</i>

8
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,100
If you're like this... It's no fun.

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,000
Come back to your senses!

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,700

00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,900
Kang Yoo Jeong, are you awake now?

23
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,300
Let's go!

24
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,080
Okay.

25
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,700
I hate it, seriously!

26
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,800
A woman dying because of me, 
I don't want to see that anymore.

27
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,600
Because of you...

28
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,800
I didn't say that to get your reply.

29
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,600
Yes!

30
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,700
Don't reply!

31
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:02,120
Just because she asked for help, 
you took all this much?

32
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,310
For a guy not making a penny, 
 you're so generous to others...

33
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,260
This is why I'm the only one suffering, just me.

34
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,480
Is In Sook one of the others?

35
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,700
She is my younger sister, 
and your in-law!

36
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:18,100
We're going to be eating those fishes anyway, 
telling her to send me a few boxes because they were not selling,

37
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,770
Was that so wrong?

38
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,150
You're only oppa to her when she needs...

39
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,150
For the decades she's been in business, 
has she ever just given us a few?

40
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,750
They said they're having a hard time.

41
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,150
They said they're having a hard time!

42
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,590
I'm having a hard time too!

43
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,720
Mom?

44
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:40,300
Our house... Can't we even afford a few fishes?

45
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,000
Who said that?

46
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,900
There are only three of us, 
but your father got too much...

47
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,500
Being a prosecutor is nothing.

48
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,070
Lots of work to do, but no increase in salary.

49
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,840
Should I quit?

50
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:59,100
If I marry a woman who will set me up 
with an attorney's office, will it be better?

51
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,930
Do you want to do that? Should I start looking one for you?

52
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,970
WHAT NOW?!

53
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,580
Why are you shouting like that?

54
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,560
You! Because you want to live a good life for yourself,

55
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,420
are you saying you want to do trashy work 
for those who are rich?

56
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,500
People who are powerless and and unfairly treated, 
I told you to become a prosecutor for those people, too!

57
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,500
That must be the limitation of my abilities.

58
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,250
So you give up?

59
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,060
If you give up because it's hard, is there anything 
that can be done in the world?

60
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,450
Then what about you, Dad?

61
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:33,750
Why did you give up?

62
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,700
What?

63
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,400
Do Hoon.

64
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,100
The life you gave up... Thanks to that,

65
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,610
I didn't even look any other way,

66
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,160
I didn't even think about anyone else!

67
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,320
That's how I have lived.

68
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,100
The dream you couldn't fulfill, 
I wanted to accomplish it in place of you.

69
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,940
That's why I...

70
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:58,490
Do you know what have I done to keep that place?

71
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:03,080
How I held out, I'm saying do you know?

72
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,520
But look at me.

73
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:13,240
Look at you two, fighting for a few fishes!

74
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,640
Me right now, I'm not the great prosecutor you think I am.

75
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,550
The righteous prosecutor that you want!

76
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:24,870
There is nothing I can do with my strength!

77
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,800
Mr. Prosecutor.

78
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,310
Do Hoon.

79
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,730
Se Yeon.

80
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:41,580
Hotel business... You shouldn't take it lightly.

81
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:46,720
If I thought it was easy, 
I would not have asked you like this, Chairman.

82
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,850
Others might think I have it easy 
just working on my paintings, but

83
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:56,260
what I have done is 
smiling and smooching the others instead of my father.

84
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:00,520
I had received the most suitable education 
in dealing with the customers.

85
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,800
Mm.

86
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,800
With the 14.2% shares Min Hyeok has,

87
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,930
It would be difficult to keep the K-Hotel.

88
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:11,630
I am a person who will soon be joining this family.

89
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,730
Chairman,

90
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,900
The hotel shares K-Construction will be selling,

91
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,340
please give them to me.

92
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,900
I heard you were supposed to get my father's hotel shares?

93
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,410
I have to take what I should take.

94
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:41,630
Because our marriage... It's business, right?

95
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,800
And what happened that day...

96
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,200
What happened that day... About what?

97
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,550
I practiced singing for days for you without sleeping, but

98
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,510
you just left, that?

99
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:57,710
Or bringing a cheap ring and asking me to marry,

100
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,510
when you were asking to please help you.

101
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,760
If that's not it either,

102
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:08,900
when you brought the person 
who killed the woman you loved, and had her sitting next to me?

103
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,330
Listen to me.

104
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,900
I thought about it. 
I tried to understand it too.

105
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,860
If Min Hyeok you died, would I have done the same thing like you?

106
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,920
I probably would've been like that for a while, 
get angry and cry...

107
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,200
But keep acting like this after years, 
it's an obsession.

108
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,400
Stop it!

109
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,650
To you and also to that dead woman...

110
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:32,150
It's a meaningless obsession that doesn't do any good.

111
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,600
I said stop it, Shin Se Yeon.

112
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,500
For all you have done, even Seo Ji Hee that woman 
would understand your heart, how sorry you are.

113
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,740
So, stop it now... Taking out your anger on others.

114
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,130
I said stop it!

115
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,690
What you're doing to that woman Kang Yoo Jeong!

116
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:50,280
It's childish. If you make that weak woman crumble,

117
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,200
do you think Seo Ji Hee will be touched because 
you're such a great person and she is grateful?

118
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,800
Hey, Shin Se Yeon!

119
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,490
I told you to stop it!

120
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,560
Right! Raise your voice to me.

121
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,380
Get angry or cry. Do it in front of me!

122
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:36,260
Read it.

123
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:41,210
The revenge started because of love... How it ends.

00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,200
My son.

137
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,100
He looks handsome right?

138
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,960
He's sick.

139
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,380
A lot.

140
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:40,490
What was that? Ummm...

141
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:44,170
I can't even remember the name. What kind of 
disease has such long name?!

142
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,960
It's a kind of a hereditary disease on the mom's side.

143
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:50,750
My son whose only sin is being born from me.

144
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,730
I have to save him. 
Whatever it takes, I have to save him.

145
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:58,210
Yes Unni, be strong.

146
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:04,200
Even though he's sick, 
you being able to stay next to him.

147
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,670
That is a blessing.

148
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:10,320
Don't make a face like that.

149
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:16,060
I promised that I would not be sad anymore because of San.

150
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:23,400
I am thankful that he came along and made me happy.

151
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,070
That's how I am going to think from now on.

152
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:30,210
That way I can live.

153
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,200

154
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,410
I'm sorry.

155
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:46,800
When I saw you and San tightly holding each other, 
I was belligerant because I was reminded of my son.

156
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,630
Because I was narrow minded.

157
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:25,340
A prosecutor under investigation isn't desirable, 
first of all.

158
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,820
Regardless, because there is a surplus of 
law school grads these days,

159
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,570
the attorneys are a dime a dozen in corporations.

160
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,700
Be that as it may,

161
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,530
how did you end things that

162
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:36,190
you're infamous in the field?

163
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:40,080
I think it'd be difficult for you to find a job prospect for a while.

164
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,740
Ah, it's just that, I really have to meet with the President.

165
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,830
Is there any way you can help me?

166
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,650
What is it, Substitute?

167
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,150
It's that I...

168
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,830
received this.

169
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:12,320
The debt I'm responsible for has been transferred to you,
President.

170
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,090
How did this happen?

171
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
That just means that you have a debt to pay me.

172
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,210
Can't you understand that?

173
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:26,200
That's what I mean. Why?

174
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,890
In order to get rid of the flies (bothersome people) near
your bakery,

175
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:31,200
I suffered a loss.

176
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:35,100
What are you looking at?

177
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,630
I will pay you back without fail.

178
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,140
I will pay you back for sure.

179
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,760
What are you doing?

180
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,400
We're going to be late for our 2 O'clock appointment.

181
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,660
I will "for sure" pay you back.

182
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:55,130
I will pay you back for sure, sir.

183
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,740
This is my contact information.

184
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,520
I won't run away.

185
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,210
I will pay you back, I swear it on my life.

186
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:04,510
So, as for that bakery...

187
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,980
Just leave that bakery as...

188
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,970
That's right. That bakery.

189
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:11,090
You're saying that is a precious place, right?

190
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,120
Yes.

191
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,470
That's why I bought it.

192
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,100
So that I can bulldoze it over.

193
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,430
I told you before.

194
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:24,470
That crap (bakery) is nothing compared to what you took away from me.

195
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,730
President. That's...

196
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,580
Look here.

197
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,610
I know what your and Min Hyeok's relationship is.

198
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,300
But, you come here to see him again?

199
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:34,410
It's not something you should get involved with.

200
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,910
I'm the person who're going to marry you.

201
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,960
Last time it was the surgery fee, this time it's the debt.

202
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,960
Are you thick-skinned or shameless?

203
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,720
Take this woman out of here.

204
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,870
Immediately!

205
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,990
President!

206
00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:00,200
President. President!!

207
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,200
Presi... Listen, please!

208
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,920

210
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,100
You left as if you won't ever see me again.

211
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,850
What brings you here?

212
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:56,000
I don't know myself as to why I came here.

213
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,040
It's just

214
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,700
that I wanted to see the other world.

215
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:09,090
Because the world I live in is too suffocating.

216
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,900
I heard you resigned your job as a prosecutor.

217
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,290
I didn't have the time to go around and see the paintings.

218
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:23,680
It was more pressing to read one more law book in that time,

219
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:28,140
and I struggled to not be surpassed by others.

220
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:33,760
Why people take their time out to see the paintings, 
now...

221
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,020
I think I know.

222
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:42,640
So, what is your impression?

223
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,700
I'd like to go there.

224
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,820
If I can go.

225
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:52,500
I'm satisfied with it because I was able to paint it in one try.

226
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,630
When you paint over a mistaken brush stroke to correct it,

227
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,300
you end up not remembering what it was that you were
trying to paint in the first place.

228
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:05,060
In those cases, one must bravely change the canvas,

229
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,730
but it's difficult to do, stupidly.

230
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,190
It's not stupid but natural.

231
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:16,530
Because regretting over the time spent to correct your mistake

232
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,680
is human.

233
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,940
That's your story, isn't it, Do Hoon?

234
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,100
I don't think you can lie well, Do Hoon.

235
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,100
Excuse me.

236
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,040
Are you okay?

237
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,840
Aiyoo. I'm okay

238
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,790
But, this bunch. I was supposed to deliver

239
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,820
quickly across the street where a car is.

240
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,910
Just give them to me. I'll do it.

241
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,900
But, do you think you may need to go to the hospital?

242
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,380
Aiyoo, it's okay.

243
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,740
I'm sorry.

244
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,760
Hello. You seem hard at work.

245
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,120
I'm going to take a look here, okay?

250
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,400
It wasn't me.

251
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,340
A woman fell down so...

252
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:24,990
Everyone says it's not theirs.

253
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,160
Excuse me.

254
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,040
You know me, right?

255
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,950
Excuse me.

256
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,890
Was it the hit-and-run?

257
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:41,980
A woman and a baby died.

258
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:46,660
I'm right.

259
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:50,130
How long has it been that you got out that now your doing this?

260
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:53,470
How could you do that, really?

261
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,140
Born in July 21st, right?

262
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,490
It was not me, really.

263
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,990
How can I trust you?

264
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:04,990
Is there a person who can guarantee your identification?

265
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,200
I enjoyed the drawings.

266
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,920
See you next time.

267
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,020
I'm on my way meeting my friend to drink.

268
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,410
Do you want to go together??

269
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,440
Last time, you just left.

270

271
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:24,740
Oh, you guys are here.

272
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,270

 Where shall we go?

274
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,730
Are you already cheating?

275
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:34,280

276
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,290

We are exactly like you think.

279
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:42,890
I like Min Hyeok because he's fun

280
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:45,710
Can you spread the rumors.

281
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,130
I don't think so.

282
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:50,380
You're right. We are in that kind of relationship.

283
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:53,080
If Se Yeon think like that.

284
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,970
What's going on here.

285
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,890
Oh.

286
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:01,270
Where are you going?

287
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,810
Let's go together with us.

288
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:06,920
Yeah. It can be boring if there are only girls.

289
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,950
What do you do?

290
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,080
What do you think he's doing?

291
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:26,000
This person, he's unemployed, he was recently a prosecutor.

292
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:32,370
How did you two meet?

293
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:35,020
Was it three years ago?

294
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,460
A black dress and

295
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,020
red high heels.

296
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:45,830
She was angry and was drunk so she yelled.

297
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:48,070
That time, she looked at me.

298
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,990
"Did you enjoy it?"

299
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,330
She said that.

300
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:58,700
That was our first meeting.

301
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,850
Do you remember that?

302
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,790
Do you remember?

303
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:11,330
Even then, we drank alcohol.

304
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:19,330
I heard that Shinha Hotel became 
the World Forum this time.

305
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:23,670
Didn't know there was something 
that Shin Se Yeon can't do.

306
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:25,260
This is not about Se Yeon.

307
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:29,030
What is this? You're defending your wife already?

308
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:32,010
Ay...you!

309
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:36,600
You don't have any friends, do you?

310
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,930
Why do I need friends?

311
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:45,070
You must be so happy. You have a lot of money but your a hobo.

312
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:48,970
But,

313
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,800
Should I marry Se Yeon?

314
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,670
Again?

315
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:56,560
Your company isn't a neighborhood store.

316
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,470
Try making a mistake.

317
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:01,480
"That's why an heir isn't good, we need a professional manager"

318
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,860
They'll all bite you right away.

319
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,660
If you want to secure your place, be good to Se Yeon.

320
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:11,660
I don't know.

321
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,690
If you're not going to do it...

322
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:16,050
Can our family take her?

323
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:17,440
What did you say?

324
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,980
Everyone is telling me to remarry.

325
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:23,310
For me, I would be thankful for Se Yeon.

326
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,290
Are you crazy?

327
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:28,000
Never.

328
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,430
She was meant for a better guy than me or you.

329
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,520
I'm warning you.

330
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,970
Don't touch her.

00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,130
Thank you.

359
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:37,880
And I'm sorry.

360
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,470
I don't have anyone else to call.

361
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,110
You refused all of my favors and...

362
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:48,560
You were doing these kind of things?

363
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,830
You even got help from Jo Min Hyeok,
 and do this kind of stuff?

364
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:54,470
It's not like that.

They'll find the job for you.

368

Yes?

373
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:34,840
- Driver

374
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,370
Hello?

375
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:38,560
Come and pick me up.

376
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,560
What?

377
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,160
- Hey, driver.

378
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:48,660
- Driver.

379
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,940
Driver, driver~

380
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,500
Take the wheel.

381
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,130
I can't drive.

382
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,050
My license was cancelled.

383
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:04,820
Oh, that's right.

384
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,970
You did a hit-and-run.

385
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Then why did you come?

386
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:17,690
I thought you were too drunk and something might happen.

387
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:21,100
So you're worried.

388
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,770
What are you?

389
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:28,150
You have time to worry...

390
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:31,520
I guess you're life is fine?

391
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,550
I'll call another driver for you.

392
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:36,800
Give me the key.

393
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,060
Let go.

394
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:49,970
No. Do you want to end up like me?

395
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,720
Customer, where should I take you?

396
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,020
Uhh, wait a second.

397
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:56,370
Hey, boss?

398
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:19,390
Did you sleep well?

399
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,900
Why are you here?

400
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:27,780
Do you not remember?

401
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,750
Yesterday, you drank a lot

402
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:34,680
so even when I asked you where you lived, you couldn't reply

403
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:51,490
Yesterday, it seems you had too much to drink.

405
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,790
Eat this.

406
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:05,900
You want me to eat this?

407
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:09,870
Eat it before it cools.

408
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:14,050
And,

409
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:22,110
I organized how I am going to pay back the debt.

410
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:28,470
These days I am learning hard at my job.
 I might be able to pay back my debt faster.

411
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:32,320
So, the bakery...

412
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,580
Spoon.

413
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:59,140
Water...
 -Huh?

414
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:02,990
Water.
 - Ah, water.

415
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,420
Why do you pour water like that?

416
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:24,750
It's alright. It's alright. Don't think about it.

417
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:27,090
Don't laugh.

418
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:30,840
Don't laugh in front of me.

419
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:59,470
Gosh.

420
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:07,040
Boss.

421
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:21,880
Here.

422
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:27,160
You phone, it's in the car from yesterday,

423
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:41,040
I'm not beholden to you, alright?

424
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,040
I'm taking this off of your debt.

425
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:45,190
Yes.

426
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:48,010
Then the bakery...

427
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:24,080
I don't want to see a person who has already refused my offer.

428
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:45,490
I didn't know that K Group had 
so much interest in paintings.

429
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:48,590
K Culture Foundation, in every year of particular time,

430
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:52,810
they've been buying new artists' art work at a high price.

431
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:59,380
Shinha Gallery is the main connection and got several million dollars from Shinha Foundation as a commission.

432
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,270
That's what I've collected for 2 years.

433
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:10,640
I get how you're maintaining a good relationship 
with Assemblyman Shin.

434
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:13,900
You came here to talk about what we all know?

435
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:17,960
There's know way that the prosecution
 doesn't know what I know.

436
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:22,580
In this country where anything can be 
excused with the word 'nation,'

437
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:28,880
K Group isn't a "national" company that deals with exports like Customs, is it?

438
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,900
To see in that way, K Group 
is a good provision for government.

439
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:39,070
Since they always need some 
other issues to turn nations' view.

440
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:44,310
There will be a public announcement of the sale of the Port of Incheon next week.

441
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:47,090
The public will demand the re-investigation of K Group.

442
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:51,320
And the Prosecution won't let it pass this time.

443
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:56,730
Why did you come to me, while you have all that?

444
00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:01,420
Please give me that opportunity, once again.

445
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:06,500
You brought me information that the Prosecutors already have.

446
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:08,610
Why should I give you another opportunity?

447
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:11,980
You see as much as you know and you can stop if you know.

448
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:19,630
You'll never ride those wheelchair again.

449
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,130
What's the reason that you turned back all of sudden?

450
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:43,770
Don't worry, I'm not trying to take your spot.

451
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:48,650
I will become the best in K-Group.

452
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:54,140
I have seen, endlessly, people that had good parents and did no work but received everything.

453
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:59,380
I want to see a junior colleague like you win.

454
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,940
But, listen well.

455
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:07,890
A person that Chairman is trying to make the best

456
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:09,960
Is only Min Hyeok.

457
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,280
You cannot be Jo Min Hyeok.

458
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:17,390
No matter how hard you try, 
you will only be a well trained dog.

459
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,400
Look after me well.

460
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,490
I am different from the Chairman.

461
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:24,030
Those who so thoroughly throw away their convictions

462
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:28,420
cannot be trusted even more.

463
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:37,260
I'll try to look after you. Good bye.

464
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:11,010
Oh my goodness! Yoo Jeong!

465
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,960
Oh my goodness!

466
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,890
Long time no see. It is nice to see you.

467
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:21,810
Did you know how worried I was when I learned you were living with her?

468
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:24,450
Is Ja Yoon being mean to you?

469
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:28,550
What do you mean? She's the one being mean to me for drinking a lot and sleeping in.

470
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:31,070
Then why don't you drink less and wake up early?

471
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:33,580
Did late year sergeant get a vacation or something?

472
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,270
Look here, Yoo Jeong.

473
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:38,240
If you're uncomfortable staying in her home or

474
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,620
if you ever get into a big fight or if you feel very sad, you can come to unni's house.

475
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:46,400
I'm single, so I'll let you have a room for cheap.

476
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,440
Yes, okay.

477
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,430
Oh, but Unni, where do you sell these?

478
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:55,520
Do you take these to the market?

479
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,000
Yoo Jeong, this is

480
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:59,420
How dare you say "this!?"

481
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:02,150
Yoo Jeong.

482
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:06,440
Don't call them "this" and "that." Call is our baby.

483
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,090
Aren't our babies so beautiful?

484
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:14,440
People go crazy and become regulars!

485
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,410
Just let us do the buying and selling.

486
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:21,000
So don't worry and just move your belongings.

487
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:26,210
Those investment to remodel the meeting room
 for assorting this year's World Forum,

488
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:28,330
How are you going to collect these?

489
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:32,780
In Shinha Hotel, the CEO personally guided 
the inspection team.

490
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:36,130
For ours, why did the general manager did it instead?

491
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:39,790
In order to recover the loss from the first half year,

492
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:42,440
You needed to make a right action for the forum.

493
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,810
Do you have a strategy for the second half year?

494
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:49,220
I heard that forum assortment 
was changed in the last minute.

495
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,150
Did you know?

496
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:54,950
They said that in the executive commission, 
it was already nominated to Shinha Hotel.

497
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:58,240
Didn't you guys already know?

498
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:03,040
The list of those who supported Shinha,

499
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,460
Should I reveal it?

500
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:20,390
<i>Hello?</i>

501
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,680
<i>Boss?</i>

00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,670

503
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:29,170

504
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:31,940

<i>Hello?</i>

506
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:11,070
Shin Se Yeon.

507
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:16,590
What is this? Is this what you meant by meeting a friend?

508
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:18,460
Something good happened to me

509
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:22,440
so I wanted be congratulated by Se Yeon.

510
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:26,740
Do I need your permission to meet with a friend?

511
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,140
A friend?

512
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,540
Let's go. The car's at the front.

513
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,500
I am also your friend.

514
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:35,730
Can't I also congratulate you?

515
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:52,510
You must really be friends.

516
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:55,130
To see that Se Yeon called you here.

517
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:57,970
I asked her to do it.

518
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:01,280
I wanted come here because there really isn't a chance to look at Se Yeon's paintings.

519
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,440
Attorney Ahn, you're very shameless than I expected.

520
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:08,220
Oh yeah, your not an attorney anymore.

521
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:10,680
It probably was hard getting into our company.

522
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,060
You have a lot of talent.

523
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:15,710
But now you need to meet some girls that fits those standards.

524
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:17,560
That's right.

525
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,780
Please introduce me to some good woman.

526
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:24,680
Is there anyone like Se Yeon?

527
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,620
Se Yeon is my fiancee.

528
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:36,740
From the time you start working at K Group, she is your superior.

529
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:39,120
Please talk with manners.

530
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:42,700
She's not someone you can meet.

531
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:46,230
If you know that well, why do you treat her like that?

532
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:48,730
Like you said, Se Yeon

533
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:50,820
is not the type of person who should be treated like that by you.

534
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:52,750
Se Yeon and I,

535
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,540
are not in the type of relationship where 
you can talk about carelessly.

536
00:43:56,540 --> 00:44:00,150
Saying it carelessly is probably you, Jo Min Hyeok.

537
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:02,260
Se Yeon,

538
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:06,480
is the type of person who I want to take away 
because she does not deserve you.

539
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,840
Just because I am sitting here drinking wine,

540
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,450
doesn't mean I'm in the same class as you.

541
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:18,270
Whatever reason you came to this company, 
you are always below me, and that is not going to change.

542
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:22,170
Just because you are being treated well, doesn't mean
 you can act like this. Isn't it so obvious?

543
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:28,940
Isn't getting a free ride more evident?

544
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:33,980
Isn't it shameless to get treated because of your parents?

545
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:36,820
Do you think that's something you can say?

546
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:40,760
Jo Min Heok, are you here to fight?

547
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,420
Didn't you just hear?

548
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:45,190
It's okay.

549
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,620
He didn't say anything wrong either.

550
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:50,780
<i>I'm</i> not alright.

551
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:54,620
He's my guest. I don't want to displease him.

552
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:07,430
You cook too?

553
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:08,760
Sometimes.

554
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,520
You've never done it for me.

555
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,400
You've never told me you want to.

556
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,690
It's good, Se Yeon.

557
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:13,100
It doesn't look like Min Hyeok has no feelings for you.

558
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:16,000
I can tell from a man's perspective.

559
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:23,270
Do Hoon, your actually a good actor.

560
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:25,700
I thought you wouldn't be good at lying.

561
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:29,190
A girl you would want to steal?

562
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:31,940
It's not a lie.

563
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:40,340
Why those main characters from the drama 
fall in love and get married in the real life,

564
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:42,540
I get it.

565
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:46,050
If you immerse in your role,

566
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:48,200
I guess those feelings actually arise.

567
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,160
It's hot.

568
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:14,640
What is this? You want me to drink this?

569
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,290
There's nothing better that this after working hard.

570
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,950
Why is it so sweet?

571
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,620
Nevermind.

572
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:31,250
Are you playing with me?

573
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:33,060
30 years?

574
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:37,380
Do I have to look at you for 30 more years just to get a little sum of money?

575
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:39,940
It's too much money for me.

576
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:42,270
I'll work harder.

577
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:45,070
Then, a few years will be taken off.

578
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,480
A few years?

579
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,160
I don't want to.

580
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,020
I heard you have a boyfriend.

581
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:52,530
Ask your boyfriend to help you.

582
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:57,010
why, did you get dumped?

583
00:47:57,470 --> 00:47:59,370
you did get dumped!

584
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:04,660
of course, what kind of man would accept a woman who hit-and-ran as his girlfriend?

585
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:05,930
He's not that kind of person.

586
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,830
What do you mean he's not. I can tell just by once glance.

587
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:11,090
You met him thinking that he was a genuine man.

588
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:13,690
Yet he took after marriage was brought up.

589
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:15,600
Aren't all those men you met like that?

590
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,940
I said it's not like that!

591
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,180
I...

592
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:26,230
do have a lot of debt because of him but,

593
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:28,140
I didn't break up with him because of that.

594
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:29,850
My oppa,

595
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:33,770
He's not the worthless kind of man you think he is.

596
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:36,460
Even after he broke up with me,

597
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,930
Even when I did stupid things,

598
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:41,770
He's a person who dropped me off 
to the hospital to save me.

599
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:44,260
He was there all night

600
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:47,630
and went away without even saying hi to me, 
because I might feel sorry.

601
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:49,780
Hey, that's...

602
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:52,640
That's..

603
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:55,570
So,

604
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:59,750
Don't talk like you know everything.

605
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:22,240
Ahn Do Hoon.

606
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:25,480
You're that great?

607
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:48,430
It's what I've been saving

608
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:50,880
and advance pay all together.

609
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,900
Severance Pay?

610
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:56,270
I've become a part of the K Group legal team.

611
00:49:56,270 --> 00:49:58,230
The benefits are good.

612
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:03,590
Do Hoon, you've decided end things with the government?

613
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:04,670
Yes.

614
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:06,940
I didn't give up my dream.

615
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:09,740
I've made a decision not to give up my dream.

616
00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:13,300
A store in Shinha plaza has opened up.

617
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:15,280
Please go take a look at it yourselves.

618
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,170
A store?

619
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:19,550
Stop doing work where you have to listen to other's dislikes.

620
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:21,990
I'll give you the money.

621
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:25,820
I'm saying this because I knew you wouldn't take a break even if I asked you to.

622
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:28,330
The two of you have fought your whole lives over your jobs.

623
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:30,830
It's become difficult for me to sit by and watch.

624
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:33,120
Suffering because of me,

625
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:36,970
living with only watching me,

626
00:50:36,970 --> 00:50:39,510
I would like to pay you back.

627
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:50,490
Mom, this looks nice.

628
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:52,860
That looks too old.

629
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:55,540
How about this one?

630
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:56,990
No, I want this one.

631
00:50:56,990 --> 00:50:59,390
I want both blue and red.

632
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:00,480
Just pick one.

633
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,430
Why?

634
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:05,180
Your only going to carry it around a few times a year. It is a waste of money.

635
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:09,820
My friends buy a lot and pick what they want daily.

636
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:13,100
You, I'm going to tell on you that you came here instead of going to your lessons.

637
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:14,570
Mom!

638
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:18,150
Whenever you talk like this, you sound like a stepmother.

639
00:51:20,730 --> 00:51:22,030
Min Joo.

640
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:26,990
Those girls get whatever they want because their parents don't care about them.

641
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:33,180
I will call someone to get Min Joo the bag you will love.

642
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:35,040
Really?

643
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:46,990
Mom, you want me to buy an imitation?

644
00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:48,990
That is not just a imitation, customer.

645
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:54,190
It is a triple A brand where the maker created with all their might.

646
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:56,600
Aigo, princess.

647
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:00,920
Our princess looks so pretty. It is a right statement.

648
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:04,290
Imitation, who would know that it is an imitation?

649
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:07,430
Whether or not it's real only depends on the person's feelings.

650
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:10,830
Now, try closing your eyes princess. One, two, three!

651
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:13,330
Give me a Dolce and Gabbana bag or Chanel.

652
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:16,480
Now, empty you thoughts.

653
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:19,080
Think that you do not know anything.

654
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:21,360
Now open your eyes. One, two, three.

655
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,860
Look at this. This line, this

656
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:26,610
brightness. Look at this beautiful bag.

657
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:28,850
Every bug will slip off this bag.

658
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:32,160
"This is a place where I shouldn't be around!" 
(Voice of a bug)

659
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,930
Now, look at this bag.

660
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:36,930
But still...

661
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:38,850
Min Joo.

662
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:41,530
Rather than carrying around the same one for a while,

663
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:45,230
wouldn't you feel better carrying a different one everyday?

664
00:52:46,410 --> 00:52:47,850
And,

665
00:52:47,850 --> 00:52:52,490
it's fun watching people get jealous over imitation bags thinking it's real.

666
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,980
Oh my goodness! Long time no see.

667
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:00,010
You're getting younger.

668
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,450
Sandara Wang, it's been a while.

669
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:05,020
Yes, I've been afar to...

670
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:08,100
New York, Seattle, Manhattan

671
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:10,420
because of business...

672
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:13,380
Please introduce yourselves. This is Madam Hong.

673
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:31,930
You know me right?

674
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:33,250
Yes.

675
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:35,650
How dare you come here?

676
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:37,750
With what in mind did you come here?

677
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:39,830
It's not like that.

678
00:53:39,830 --> 00:53:41,880
You're a bold one, aren't you?

679
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:46,250
Last time you sold that ring and now you dare to set foot in the house?

680
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:49,710
You face looks naive but your actions are like a fox.

681
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:54,180
Mink Hyeok's taste is so... peculiar.

682
00:53:56,790 --> 00:53:58,810
Why are you here?

683
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:02,880
What are you doing?

684
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,700
Min Hyeok.

685
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:07,150
Now your meeting this kind of woman?

686
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:09,830
No, the boss and I don't have that kind of relationship.

687
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:11,670
What kind of woman is this kind of woman?

688
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:13,990
Do you have to tell you with my own mouth?

689
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:17,460
You can just tell that she sticks by smelling money.

690
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:22,440
Don't meet with Min Hyeok again.

691
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:26,660
I'm not the type of person who has respect, so I don't know what I'm going to do next time.

692
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:33,950
What do you think your doing?

693
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:39,610
I can understand a man acting like this before a marriage.

694
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:42,370
But Min Hyeok.

695
00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:44,530
If your going to meet a woman, pick one with more class.

696
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:47,250
That isn't something Ahjumma can say.

697
00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:49,670
You looked at dad's money.

698
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:55,240
You came here in this house waiting for my mom to die. Is that something you can say?

699
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:00,590
Let's go.

700
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:11,450
Are you crazy?

701
00:55:11,450 --> 00:55:13,610
Now your even following me to my house?

702
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:16,180
I didn't know this was you house.

703
00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:19,570
You said you were going to pay your debt but now your doing stuff like this.

704
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:25,900
I'm seeing you frequently these days, my friend.

705
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:33,750
I can't today. We have things to discuss.

706
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:43,360
I sent a present to Ahn Do Hoon's house. Did you get it?

707
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:46,410
I hope you like it.

708
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:04,270
Do you want a glass?

709
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:10,480
I told have the time to drink at this time of the day.

710
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,790
You know Attorney Do Hoon right?

711
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:14,720
No,

712
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:18,890
he's not an attorney anymore since he works in my company now.

713
00:56:18,890 --> 00:56:21,090
He's Lawyer Do Hoon.

714
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:24,390
Did you not know?

715
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:26,470
What's wrong with your expression?

716
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,710
Do you have a prior relation with Lawyer Do Hoon?

717
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:31,380
No.

718
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:34,020
He's my friend.

719
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:38,320
Now that I think about it, because of you, I gained a friend.

720
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,080
Why?

721
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,770
Is it weird that we're friends?

722
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:49,630
Lawyer Do Hoon, looked at us like that earlier.

723
00:56:59,470 --> 00:57:01,310
Yes, unni.

724
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:04,030
I'm going now.

725
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:10,760
I won't ever come find you anymore.

726
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:22,860
It's important to look and seem smart and elegant even when selling one item.

727
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:25,470
Unnie, don't forget we're splitting 7:3, and I'm 7.

728
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:28,270
How about some soju and stew?

729
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,190
Hey.

730
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:43,900
What are you doing?

731
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:46,330
Do you know who he is?

732
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:47,310
I know.

733
00:57:47,310 --> 00:57:48,750
You know?

734
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:50,060
Although you know, your still like this?

735
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:52,590
Then what about you?

736
00:57:52,590 --> 00:57:55,230
You quit being an attorney.

737
00:57:55,230 --> 00:57:58,220
Now your working in that company? What does that mean?

738
00:57:58,670 --> 00:58:00,160
I heard you two are friends.

739
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,810
Friends?

740
00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:03,130
Yes,

741
00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:07,270
He does whatever he wants with his friends, I guess I can call him a friend.

742
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:11,620
I didn't quit being an attorney and entered the company on my own will.

743
00:58:13,970 --> 00:58:17,800
I don't want to talk long.

744
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:23,020
I have a debt.

745
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:27,710
All of my debt went to him. I don't know how it happened.

746
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:31,810
Yoo Jeong. Wake up.

747
00:58:31,810 --> 00:58:34,300
Joo Min Hyeok has played with you for a reason.

748
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:35,980
I can't pay back a debt.

749
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:39,400
Do you know what Jo Min Hyeok did?

750
00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:46,930
Do you know how much I hate him?

751
00:58:46,970 --> 00:58:48,550
DO you know who disgusted I am?

752
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:51,140
Stop saying stupid things like that!

753
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:53,000
We've already paid our debt.

754
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:56,190
We had a long and tiring four years.

755
00:58:56,230 --> 00:58:58,420
Listen to me.

756
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:03,600
I'm worried.

757
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,550
Stay away from Min Hyeok.

758
00:59:05,550 --> 00:59:09,100
I'll look into te debt and contact you.

759
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:28,940
Lee Yea Jin.

760
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:36,860
Yea Jin!

761
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,170
Ahh!

762
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:58,370
Ahh sshi! You're not going to go!

763
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,610
I'm not going to run!

764
00:59:59,610 --> 01:00:01,290
I said, I'm not going to run!

765
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:12,280
Just hurry up and hit me.

766
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,750
Isn't that why you followed me?

767
01:00:16,630 --> 01:00:19,490
What rotten luck to meet you like this...

768
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:23,890
What if I hit you?

769
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:28,320
If I hit you, will San come back alive?

770
01:00:31,350 --> 01:00:32,370
Then get hit!

771
01:00:32,370 --> 01:00:34,390
Get hit a hundred, a thousand times!

772
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:35,980
Ahh!

773
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,310
Ahh!

774
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:43,780
Why are you like this?

775
01:00:43,830 --> 01:00:47,460
San? What about San?

776
01:00:48,190 --> 01:00:50,550
Why are you like this?

777
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:03,930
He died.

778
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:10,500
The work place.

779
01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:14,880
That's the last time

780
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:19,420
I hugged my San.

781
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:26,120
At first, I wondered what I would do when I met you.

782
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:29,660
Every night, I thought about how to relieve my heart.

783
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:32,260
That's how I spent my time.

784
01:01:34,810 --> 01:01:36,870
Why did you do it?

785
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:41,780
I have always been curious about that.

786
01:01:41,830 --> 01:01:44,410
Why did you

787
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:47,330
Why did you do that to San?

788
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,100
Why did you do it?

789
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:53,410
Why did you do it!

790
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:55,600
I didn't know.

791
01:01:56,410 --> 01:01:58,790
I'm not like you but,

792
01:01:58,790 --> 01:02:00,230
I also liked San.

793
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:03,700
I really did. I thought that San would be alright.

794
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:05,650
Unni,

795
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:09,190
Unni, they only wanted me to make you fail your test.

796
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:15,470
Test?

797
01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:18,190
I only did what I was told.

798
01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:21,850
Unni,

799
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:26,060
did you ever do someone wrong?

800
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:30,520
<i>Do you know what Min Hyeok did to you? </i>

801
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:32,610
<i>Be carefree when your inside,</i>

802
01:02:32,610 --> 01:02:35,700
<i>When you get out, your life will get hard. </i>

803
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:41,430
<i>Try hurting as much as me. </i>

804
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:46,040
<i>Lose the most precious person to you. </i>

805
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:22,090
<i>Congratulations on your entrance.</i>

806
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:06,940
<i>♫ Each of us, we have loved 
Each of us, we have shed tears</i>

807
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:10,970
<i>♫ Living under the same sky</i>

808
01:04:10,970 --> 01:04:14,110
<i>♫ It was happiness to me</i>

809
01:04:15,450 --> 01:04:17,120
<i>What is this? </i>

810
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:19,270
<i>Why are you here?</i>

811
01:04:19,270 --> 01:04:22,580
<i>You said that person looked at the dead person and walked away right?</i>

812
01:04:22,620 --> 01:04:24,390
<i>Are you sure it's this woman's footprint? </i>

813
01:04:24,390 --> 01:04:27,450
<i>It was taken on the day of Ji Hee's accident. </i>

814
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:28,620
<i> If you know </i>

815
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:32,200
<i>how much about Ahn Do Hoon, you would be surprised. </i>

816
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:35,640
<i>Is the blackbox file filed? </i>

817
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:39,050
<i>Can I ask of a favor as friends?</i>

818
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:40,480
<i>On the day of the accident, </i>

819
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:44,940
<i>did you really leave after looking? </i>
