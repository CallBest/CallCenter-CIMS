<i>Episode 10</i>

5
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:08,290
I'm saying I'll pay you back.

6
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:11,450
Even if I work like this, I'm saying I'll pay that debt.

7
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,190
But why did you even follow me here and do this?

8
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:18,130
Tell people I'm a woman who killed a person, a convict, 
and make a scene to get me kicked out again?

9
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,100
Why do you do this, really!

10
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,170
Do I just look like a jerk like that to you?

11
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,970
Alright... alright, you have a point.

12
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:33,970
In any event... in any event, let's go up.

13
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,960
Let go! Let go!

14
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,940
Let go! 
- I'm saying let's go up.

15
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,210
Why are you doing this? 
Are you crazy?

16
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,200
Yes! I feel like I'm going crazy!

17
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,450
Worrying about you is driving me crazy! 
So stay glued to my side!

18
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,690
If you don't come with me now, 
I can start an even worse rumor.

19
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:22,620
Wherever you go, 
I'll do that following you around.

20
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,290
If that's what it takes to have you in front of me, 
I can definitely do that!

21
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,680
Why?

22
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,360
You said you hate the thought of seeing me, 
just why?

23
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,470
That day, you were with Ahn Do Hoon.

24
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:43,570
Because I'm about to go crazy from curiosity, 
just what you two have cooked up.

25
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,700
So, don't disappear from my eyes.

26
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,220
Do you now feel like going back?

27
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,900
He is a person who doesn't matter to me, I told you.

28
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:09,510
Then, whatever I do to Ahn Do Hoon, 
you're saying it doesn't matter to you?

29
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,580
It's me.

30
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:25,610
Right now, immediately, 
Ahn Do Hoon in the Legal Team, fire him.

31
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,260
There is no reason, do as you're told!

32
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:27,920
President?

33
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,880
Call the other law firms, too, 
tell them not to accept Ahn Do Hoon.

34
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,700
You're pushing it!

35
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,770
What are you?

36
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,700
Just what is Ahn Do Hoon to you?!

37
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,380
What is he?!

38
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,360
Get off.

39
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,190
Is this where you said you were going to?

40
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,310
Go to work tomorrow.

41
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,070
Pardon?

42
00:04:55,070 --> 00:05:00,580
The restaurant, as usual... I'm saying go to work.

43
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,760
Get off.

44
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:33,240
We're going to donate our congratulatory money 
to Shin Ah Foundation.

45
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,360
I think it would be good for the K-Group to also donate, 
if you consider the image.

46
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:46,290
Since we're the ones preparing for the wedding, 
giving the congragulatory money to Shin Ah Foundation on top of that seems somewhat...

47
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,410
The thank-you gifts for the guests 
have been determined to be the german porcelain, but

48
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,530
what are your thoughts on quantity?

49
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:56,780
We settled on 1000 people on our side, so

50
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,080
you can adjust appropriately, Madam,

51
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,630
keeping high standards.

52
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:04,480
You have a flair for things a bit glamorous, right?

53
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:09,690
People in that line of work, 
I would rather not have them at the wedding.

54
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,340
For my son's wedding,

55
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,320
are you asking me to discriminate the guests?

56
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:20,910
I wouldn't have said anything separate like this, 
to Min Hyeok's real mother.

57
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:24,700
Since this is a discussion for the two of you, and it will go on even without me,

58
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,910
I'll leave first.

59
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,310
Min Hyeok.

60
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,540
Isn't attending the wedding all you wanted?

61
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,940
Mother?

62
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,750
What is this? How did she get back in?

63
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,640
They said it was the President's order.

64
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,030
No wonder. Ever since this morning, the manager's condition was...

65
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:02,830
What relationship does she have with the President?

66
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:11,040
Welcome! It's nice to meet you, customer!

67
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,230
Hey, Substitute!

68
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,020
Get in.

69
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,370
I said get in.

70
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,980
Yeah, Unni let's take the ride, what else..

71
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,740
Why should we refuse?

72
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,900
Let's go! Let's go, let's go.

73
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,070
Thank you.

74
00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:00,520
Wow... this car is really nice! 
Isn't it, Unni?

75
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,870
Your driving is very smooth, 
you're a good driver.

76
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:07,160
What aren't you good at?

77
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,180
But President, how did you meet Unni?

78
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,290
Hye Ri...

79
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,490
let's just go quietly.

80
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:25,190
But Unni, did you thank him?

81
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,690
For what?

82
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:32,570
The president went all crazy on the manager, 
for firing you and telling him to bring you back.

83
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,880
"If the manager doesn't trust the employees 
and lets them go, what is he trying to do?".

84
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,700
Like this. It was really cool.

85
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,060
Have dinner before you leave!

86
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,740
Hey, you dropped us all the way here, at least eat before you go.

87
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,430
Hye Ri, they don't want to eat here.

88
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,370
Leave, please.

89
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:07,720
Boss, our Unni's cooking skills are no joke.

90
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,540
You're really going to regret if you don't eat it. Yes?

91
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:13,900
Forget the food, I have something to say.

92
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:19,040
Let's go.

93
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,160
Hey! Hey!

94
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,730
You said you have something to say.

95
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:43,860
Do you have nothing to say?

96
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,170
I don't know what you want to hear from me, but

97
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,310
I have nothing to say.

98
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,470
Don't then.

99
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,790
Because I can find out.

100
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,800
There's nothing like that.

101
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,010
Sure, keep insisting like that.

102
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:59,000
Boss. 
 -That bakery...

103
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:04,330
Because it's in a bad neighborhood, 
the price won't go up, and it doesn't sell,

104
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,000
Keeping it incurs loss.

105
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:11,800
Why don't you pay off your debt quickly, 
and take it back.

106
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,220
Gwang Soo!

107
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,930
Yes.

108
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,310
Let's go.

109
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:33,430
Look, just look at that. They say you don't even bother
dogs when they're eating.

110
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,640
Crass ass, for real.

111
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,040
Min Hyeok!

112
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,800
Min Hyeok!

113
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,960
What are you doing?

114
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,110
Uh...

115
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:31,560
Your tuxedo is finished. Try it on.

116
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,860
I told you not to touch it, didn't I?

117
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:44,900
When Chairman threw all your mom's things out,

118
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,890
the one who saved at least this was me.

119
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:50,590
So?

120
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:53,080
So, do you want me to be thankful?

121
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,340
No.

122
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:02,120
I just wanted to hear it once more.

123
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,800
Is this the right place he asked us to meet him?

124
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,170
That's what I'm saying.

125
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:38,890
It was a call from a secretary to come have dinner here.

126
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:42,200
From a secretary!

127
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,070
Why don't you straighten up your back?

128
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,660
Our son works here,

129
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,830
so what is there to be intimidated about?

130
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,910
Omo, look who's here.

131
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,570
Hello.

132
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:00,180
Were you going to meet us with Do Hoon, together?

133
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,780
No. I was the one who asked to meet you here.

134
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,990
Se Yeon.

135
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,640
I'm sorry I didn't consult you.

136
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,810
Because you treated me to such a wonderful dinner,

137
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:15,080
I wanted to repay you for sure.

138
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:18,150
Ah, you... didn't have to do that.

139
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,130
It was so delicious.

140
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:24,410
I should join you, but my work just won't end.

141
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:27,020
Mother, Father. Enjoy your dinner, okay?

142
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,170
Eh-alright.

143
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,820
O-o-kay.

144
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,750
<i>Treat them well.</i>

145
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:38,590
When you see her in this setting, she seems pretty affluent too.

146
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:41,120
Just what does her family do?

147
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,300
She seems to have been raised well.

148
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,960
She's pleasant to elders and all.

149
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:59,960
SInce it was deleted, it'll be difficult from the get-go 
to check the black box video.

150
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,670
I can venture a guess as to who's responsible,
 but I don't have the proof.

151
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,150
You too are curious as to what was in that video, right?

152
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,050
Yes.

153
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:08,130
Then restore it.

154
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,300
Ah, Attorney Ahn.

155
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,840
Did you touch other material in the Security Office?

156
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,570
What do you mean?

157
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:27,330
I got a call that there's damaged data.

158
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:30,230
It seems Min Hyeok ordered it to be restored.

159
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:33,220
What's the material that both of you are looking for?

160
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:37,260
I'm not sure with what motive you're asking that sort of question,

161
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,340
but I only checked the data related to 
Pyeongchang Construction.

162
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,270
Is that so?

163
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,130
Yes.

164
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:07,350
Ah, you don't have to come too.

165
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,320
I will escort you to the airport.

166
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,550
- Never mind.
- Chairman.

167
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,190
Don't worry.

168
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:17,850
Be sure to help Min Hyeok while I'm gone.

169
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,680
Yes, sir.

170
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,950
Ah, and

171
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:33,800
about Director Ahn Do Hoon. There's a limit to how much
encouragement one can bestow.

172
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,890
Gwang Min, you make preparation well

173
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:42,530
to break him when it's necessary.

174
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:45,700
Okay, let's go.

175
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:01,040
What kind of request was this long?

176
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,840
He is the head of K-Group.

177
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,690
Even his momentary absence causes rumors to fly here.

178
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:10,310
Today's Tasting Event, is the preparation going alright?
- Yep.

179
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,420
Here are the plates.

180
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,120
Hey, Ms. Yoo Jeong. Please bring me the meat and onions.

181
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,730
Yes, I got it.

182
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:37,890
This is the list of people who'll be attending today's event.

183
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:46,370
<i>Ahn Do Hoon.</i>

184
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,700
Kang Yoo Jeong went to work today, right?

185
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,200
Yes.

186
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,220
Let's go to Hap Jeong Dong.

187
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,150
It has arrived.

188
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,490
There are more.

189
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:00,460
Quickly bring more of this.

190
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,970
- Ms. Kang Yoo Jeong.
-Yes?

191
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,340
President would like to see you.

192
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,750
What for?

193
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:19,210
I said I'll pay you for the day. Go.

194
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:19,760
President.

195
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,630
I said stop working for the day. How many times do I have to tell you?

196
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:28,140
As is, there's a lot of talk about how I came in with your influence.

197
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,390
I'd rather not make a tough situation since I've decided to work here.

198
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,630
Substitute. Just do as I say.

199
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,610
Don't work but be paid.

200
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:40,100
Why do I have to do that?

201
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,070
Guests have arrived.

202
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:48,760
Then I'll be going back to work.

203
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,140
Substitute! Hey, Substitute!

204
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,080
Aigoo, President Jo Min Hyeok.

205
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,550
Ah...

206
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,010
Welcome.

207
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,510
It's been a while.

208
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:57,620
Yes, it has.

209
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,670
- Got it?
- I got it.

210
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,480
Tell Kang Yoo Jeong to avoid coming out to the floor.

211
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,060
That's a little...

212
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,690
Why?

213
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,920
- I believe he picked a wrong place to belong.
- Right.

214
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,300
Here you are.

215
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:30,790
Do you work here?

216
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,740
Yes.

217
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:36,560
I will slice up the steak for you.

218
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:45,360
What's the standard for employee selection here?

219
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,450
That is not my role so...

220
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:52,780
I'm sorry.

221
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,450
It's more accurate to say that you're brazen rather than senseless.

222
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,510
Let's just discuss about the taste of the food.

223
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:04,660
Today is a tasting event, not an employee review day.

224
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,850
If you're finished, get back inside.

225
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,310

226
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:35,420
Do Hoon, that was Do Hoon Oppa, right?

227
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:36,760
What the heck? What the heck? Driving me crazy, seriously! Wow!!!

228
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,130
How can you run into him like this?

229
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:41,980
Unni, don't go out there. I'll do it.

230
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,820
Hye Ri, will you get some water for me?

231
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,670
Okay.

232
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:03,920
Weren't you supposed to have quit working?

233
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,620
I had some things happen.

234
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,510
It's difficult to find job elsewhere as well.

235
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,350
If it's difficult,

236
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:17,330
are you saying that you'd just grab onto whomever would help?

237
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:20,000
Don't you know who Jo Min Hyeok is?

238
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,830
Don't you know why he's holding on to you?

239
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:24,910
Oppa. I also don't like him. Hate him.

240
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,520
I heard about the parole, too.

241
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,900
I also know it all.

242
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,430
But if I'm still like this,

243
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:36,160
couldn't you first consider 
that there would be a reason?

244
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:39,430
The parole?

245
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,720
What are you talking about?

246
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,440
Never mind.

247
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,480
It has nothing to do with you.

248
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,590
I have to go to work.

249
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:50,320
What are you talking about?

250
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:52,630
Move away.

251
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:55,110
I'll make sure you don't get hurt.

252
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,790
You,

253
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:02,520
you being here,

254
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,590
don't you know that's strangling my neck?

255
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:07,770
Is there even any reason I shouldn't be here?

256
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:11,370
President Jo knowing about 
the relationship between you and me?

257
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,990
What about that? What about our relationship?

258
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,780
We have no relationship now.

259
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,110
You!

260
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:22,410
I'm saying seeing you is hard.

261
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,120
Seeing you in front of me,

262
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:30,100
evertime I feel my ankle is being shackled, 
it's so horrifying!

263
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:50,950
The facilities are good,

264
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,080
and the employees are efficient.

265
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,990
Don't play with Yoo Jeong.

266
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:59,490
You said with your own mouth that she has nothing to do with you.

267
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:07,200
What about you Min Hyeok,

268
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,180
what is the reason that you keep Yoo Jeon?

269
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:14,930
I told you before.

270
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,910
I have an attraction for her.

271
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,930
As I keep seeing Yoo Jeong, it keeps getting more fun.

272
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,590
I'm curious.

273
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,730
You're curious.

274
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,790
Your curiosity is the problem.

275
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:30,570
She's my employee so I'll take care of it.

276
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:33,180
She has nothing to do with you.

277
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,720
Are you done talking?

278
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,710
See me.

279
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,020
You choose the wedding cards.

280
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,100
You can do at least that much.

281
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,360
I'm not doing this marriage by myself.

282
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:08,550
That woman,

283
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,180
what is she to you?

284
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,230
There is no reason for you to know.

285
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,630
This isn't a marriage, it's business.

286
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:37,080
Substitute driver.

287
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:46,880
You disappeared as soon as it ended. But why are you coming home now?

288
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:50,620
I didn't make you guys meet on purpose.

289
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:53,280
You're going to think that I did it.

290
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,120
Last time,

291
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,660
I did it.

292
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,910
But this time, it wasn't me.

293
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,650
Don't get mad at me.

294
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,670
I told you.

295
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:12,340
You should have gone when I told you to.

296
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:15,200
Thank you for paying attention to me.

297
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:18,740
Good Bye.

298
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:28,750
You met me then but

299
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:31,360
you abandoned me!

300
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,400
you abandoned me

301
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,610
its a lie

302
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:40,310
It's a lie It's a lie It's a-

303
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,720
It's a liee!!

304
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:44,780
Oh my

305
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:48,270
Yoo Jeong. Our pretty Yoo Jeong is here.

306
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,510
Sit here.

307
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:54,080
Unni brought an expensive brand name bag from China

308
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,740
Here. 
All you brought back is one bottle and your making such a big deal.

309
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,560
Drink. Drink.

310
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,790
Lets celebrate our bag business being ruined.

311
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:06,030
Ayo so sad

312
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:09,850
Noo, it's so very sad

313
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:13,230
What will we eat to live now?

314
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:15,480
Live by eating our feelings

315
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:26,890
Hey! hey hey hey hey hey

316
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:29,330
You eat, eat eat eat

317
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:33,420
first eat, and then drink after

318
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,700
Ahhw

319
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,220
This..

320
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:43,150
If you place one dot on the word for sir, it becomes stranger.

321
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:46,570
Men are the ones that turn into strangers after you break up with them.

322
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:51,120
But it's strange, when he's not next to me I'm sad.

323
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,420
When he's next to me, it's very good.

324
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:57,110
Ohh men are the problem. Right Ja young?

325
00:25:57,110 --> 00:26:01,920
Of course. You have to eat to live, 
 you don't need a man.

326
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,180
It doesn't matter.

327
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,050
How does love change?

328
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:07,950
You!

329
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:11,000
Love doesn't change, people change.

330
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,000
So, you have to pick a smart person.

331
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,160
A smart person.

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,600
Yoo Jeong.

336
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,710
Hello.

337
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,960
We didn't see you at all for a while. What are you 
doing here at this time?

338
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,400
This...

339
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,910
This. It's this places' receipt right?

340
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:55,750
Yes. It's ours.

341
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,960
This is my dad's jacket.

342
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:03,320
You dad came here frequently and bought cream bread.

343
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:07,930
He couldn't get away from where he lived his whole life.

344
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:12,760
But, every time he came, there was a woman with him.

345
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:17,600
But that day, he came alone.

346
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:20,870
Ah! Your father looked really well!

347
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:24,660
That day, he even recognized me.

348
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,190
That day, is this the day?

349
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:30,470
I don't know whether it was that night or not.

350
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,300
You know, that day it poured rain.

351
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,460
A man came and took him.

352
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,350
Wasn't he the man who was supposed to be your husband?

354
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:18,300
You must have a lot of free time.

355
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,600
You even have time to read a book.

356
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,450
It's all because of you.

357
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:27,230
Just because you moved the board,

358
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:30,170
don't think that you can treat me like a puppet.

359
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:32,550
I told you it's not like that.

360
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,750
The board already...

361
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,080
I don't care.

362
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,380
It wouldn't have even mattered if they fired me unanimously.

363
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:41,430
The important thing is you.

364
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:42,830
You couldn't have done that.

365
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:43,460
Min Hyeok.

366
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,040
I told you.

367
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,310
Don't pull Do Hoon close to you.

368
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,400
Us,

369
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,780
we are not even friends anymore.

370
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,320
Get out of my room.

371
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,850
Get in.

372
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,010
What is this?

373
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:32,350
Today, the President wants you to work at his house.

374
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:34,980
We already told the restaurant.

375
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:37,050
I can't skip on my own will.

376
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:39,770
Tell him that I'll go to the restaurant.

377
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,890
I brought her.

378
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:57,890
Okay.

379
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,520
Why did you call me?

380
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,570
You're my employee. Work here today.

381
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:08,210
What?

382
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:12,220
Since I sent the employee that works here 
on a vacation, the house is a mess.

383
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,370
You do it instead.

384
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,450
Clean this up too.

385
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,070
Who are you?

386
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,240
Where is Myung Ae Ahjumma?

387
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,840
She went on a vacation so it...

388
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,270
Why a vacation so suddenly?

389
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:08,180
I want something spicy.

390
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,380
This is really tasty.

391
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:19,500
Unni, eat with me. It's really good.

392
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:22,760
Quickly, sit.

393
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,690
Hey.

394
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:29,490
Have you eaten?

395
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,170
Taste it.

396
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:36,240
Eat it. Quickly!

397
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,240
You only listen to Min Hyeok oppa. Quickly!

398
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:45,210
Isn't it good?

399
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,330
Yes.

400
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:52,500
What's up with your reaction? You're really boring just like my brother even though you guys aren't siblings.

401
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,740
Oppa,

402
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:59,670
what does Ahjussi like to eat?

403
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:03,190
Lawyer Chae. Does he have anything he likes?

404
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:06,460
Cup Ramen.

405
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,410
He likes it.

406
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:11,550
What? What is that?

407
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:13,690
When he was young,

408
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:16,440
he said he ate it really well.

409
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,540
Oppa, try this.

410
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:31,400
The new unni, she's a really good cook.

411
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:35,550

412
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:43,610
Get me some coffee.

413
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:48,340
Eat it all. I ate some while making it.

414
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,850
The coffee is in the kitchen?

415
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,050
This, where should I put it?

416
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,010
I cleaned everything. There is nothing to do.

417
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,120
If you don't have anything for me to do, I'll leave.

418
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,990
Why do you have nothing to do? No.

419
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,450
Bring that.

420
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:39,890
And, you have something to do.

421
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:41,670
Read this book.

422
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,200
Take it!

423
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:48,570
I'm curious about the story but i'm too bothered to read it.

424
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:51,980
Read it and write a summary.

425
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,250
Now.

426
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,800
Wait.

427
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,390
Don't be in front of me.

428
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,850
Go over there and read quietly.

429
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:50,930
You really do come when I call for you.

430
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,020
Did you call me to see you like this?

431
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:57,640
You're the only person I show myself to like this.

432
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:00,700
Why are you so sad?

433
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,870
Is it because you met with Min Hyeok?

434
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:08,120
I thought the wedding preparations were going well.

435
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,880
It does look like that.

436
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,630
But, I think were getting farther.

437
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,750
I thought that's how you were going to get him.

438
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:22,910
You being sad because of Min Hyeok,

439
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:25,180
I don't want to see it.

440
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,780
Stop drinking.

441
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,910
You should have been born into a better family.

442
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:53,550
Had your family been close to my family,

443
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:57,930
I might have liked you first instead of Min Hyeok.

444
00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:01,370
No one is born picking their parents.

445
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,370
When a family is made,

446
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,550
there is no picking.

447
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,270
Except your spouse.

448
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:10,060
But you know something?

449
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,940
Se Yeon,

450
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,380
the only choice that you had,

451
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,340
you gave it up yourself

452
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:19,660
You want to drink, right?

453
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,420
Then drink.

454
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:26,460
Hey, Ahn Do Hoon!

455
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,030
Come here.

456
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,890
Have a glass.

457
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:15,720
You brought a car?

458
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,590
I'll call a substitute driver.

459
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:32,530
Boss. Boss.

460
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:40,660
Yeah.

461
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,530
I'll leave.

462
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,310
Come to work here again.

463
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:46,150
Boss.

464
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:49,510
Yeah, I'm the boss. So come here.

465
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,520
Yes.

466
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,850
<i>Heathcliff and Catherine were fated to love...but Catherine ends up in a contract marriage to a nobleman...</i>

467
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:28,800
<i>Catherine didn't get to hear the confession of his love and Heathcliff seeks revenge on the already married Catherine</i>

468
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:32,180
<i>Read this. </i>

469
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,390
<i>A revenge that started because of love, </i>

470
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:37,580
<i>how it ends. </i>

471
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:41,200
<i>...Heathcliff who loses his real love Catherine, dies 
a lonely death.</i>

472
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:53,600
That person. Just because he lent you some money,
 isn't he taking advantage of you?

473
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,230
Our boss isn't doing this because of money.

474
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:59,820
It didn't seem that he called me to take advantage of me.

475
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:03,200
Hey! Hey, hey, hey. Wake up.

476
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:08,600
There's no answer if you fall for those rich guys who are having a passing curiosity.

477
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,240
But unni, how long do you have to go?

478
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:15,560
The manager was so mad that today's shift was 
all messed up.

479
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,890
He was so annoyed saying that he might have to find another part-timer...

480
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:23,000
I'll tell him tomorrow. This doesn't seem right.

481
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,830
Boss.

482
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:21,350
Boss.

483
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:41,400
(Min Hyeok's signature)

484
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:47,020
<i> Some man signed it. </i>

485
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:15,770
What are you. What are you doing right now?

486
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:18,140
This.

487
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,100
This. I need to wash it.

488
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,500
Please move away.

489
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,700
What is this?

490
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:30,600
Why is a girl so strong?

491
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:42,070
Thank you.

492
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,750
That day,

493
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:51,650
you took me to the hospital.

494
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,600
For saving me,

495
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,330
thank you.

496
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:58,440
Yeah,

497
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:02,930
who told you to faint in someone else's building?

498
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:06,970
Go away.

499
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:23,100
<i>♫ For me to have</i>

500
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,700
<i>♫ Too precious that person</i>

501
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:33,400
<i>♫ I dare love that person</i>

502
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:38,200
<i>♫ To a bad person like me</i>

503
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:42,730
<i>♫ Not a good match</i>

504
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:46,270
<i>♫ I love the one person</i>

505
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:51,050
<i>♫ That person is you</i>

506
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:54,060
<i>♫ Even though I cannot say</i>

507
00:43:54,060 --> 00:44:01,700
<i>♫ Hot enough to get burned 
The tears in my heart</i>

508
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:08,160
<i>♫ If I can pour it out to you, 
my love</i>

509
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:16,100
<i>♫ Love or farewell 
In the world where there is none</i>

510
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:22,400
<i>♫ I want to meet you once again</i>

511
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:26,290
<i>♫ My love</i>

512
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,100
<i>♫ For me to call</i>

<i>♫ Too precious that name</i>

514
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:38,700
<i>♫ I want to shout but</i>

515
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:44,000
<i>♫ I swallow it again today</i>

516
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:46,920
<i>♫ It's the cold lies again</i>

517
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:50,650
<i>♫ Love brings tears</i>

518
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:54,650
<i>♫ Tears then bring love</i>

519
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:59,300
<i>♫ I say please embrace but</i>

520
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,900
<i>♫ My love</i>

521
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,300
<i>♫ When my tears dry out</i>

522
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:09,070
<i> Wouldn't it be great if dad came by San? </i>

523
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:13,460
<i> Maybe our San might be able to eat jjajangmyeon. </i>

524
00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:18,570
<i>♫ My love</i>

525
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:34,470
If you don't have anything for me to do, I'll leave.

526
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:38,530
Starting tomorrow, I'll go to the restaurant.

527
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:41,930
I heard the other employees are having a hard time because of me.

528
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:44,540
I have no honor.

529
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:28,590
Un-

530
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:30,300
Unni.

531
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:35,500
You! 
Ahh!

532
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:39,100
What?

533
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:42,700
I won't be satisfied even if I hit her more. Why did you stop me?

534
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,350
Didn't you say what you wanted you say that time?

535
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:47,970
Why did you come here?

536
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:50,780
What is this? You guys met?

537
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:53,970
But you just left her?

538
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:56,100
Unni,

539
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:59,100
I'm sorry.

540
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:01,450
I didn't know.

541
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:04,380
I can't sleep well.

542
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:06,900
Because I think of San.

543
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:10,020
I'm really sorry.

544
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:13,340
If I didn't say this, I would regret it forever.

545
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:15,930
You! If your sorry,

546
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:19,320
then why did you do that to a child?
 San's name can come out of your mouth?

547
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:22,360
I really didn't know!

548
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,300
Why are you yelling?

549
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:27,600
The child's body was all blue. Are you a human?

550
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:30,800
No, it's alright. I didn't know.

551
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:34,230
Stop. Please.

552
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:41,570
Saying that you didn't know

553
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,120
is not a reason to be forgiven.

554
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,200
Unni.

555
00:48:01,350 --> 00:48:05,030
(message from Do Hoon)

556
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:10,030
I'm in front of your house. I'll wait for you.

557
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:35,380
You said that seeing me pained you.

558
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:38,280
What is it?

559
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,750
I think Jo Min Hyeok is restarting the investigation

560
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:45,160
of the hit-and-run case.

561
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:50,160
Is it you?

562
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,000
Oppa.

563
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,510
Did you feel you were treated unfairly?

564
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:56,820
Then how should I interpret you sticking close to Min Hyeok.

565
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:07,450
It's not what your thinking of.

566
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:12,070
I'm not worrying.

567
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,200
You were the one driving.

568
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:21,590
You,

569
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:25,380
decided that yourself.

570
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,470
That,

571
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,900
did you come to confirm that?

572
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:02,430
I have something to confirm too.

573
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,290
Yesterday,

574
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:10,280
that supermarket in front of the railroad,

575
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:15,180
the woman said that she saw you

576
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:17,930
the day that Dad disappeared.

577
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:20,350
She said that you took Dad.

578
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:23,210
Is it true?

579
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:26,200
No.

580
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:30,650
She probably saw wrong.

581
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:31,980
Is it true?

582
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:36,200
Yeah.

583
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,260
Lies.

584
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:44,140
Oppa, you don't know how to lie.

585
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:16,670
Unni.

586
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:20,100
What? Did that person say something again?

587
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:22,160
What do you mean by again?

588
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,090
The person that wanted to stop your parole.

589
00:51:25,090 --> 00:51:27,760
What do you mean?

590
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:32,560
He told me to stop your parole...

591
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:38,130
Tell me more clearly. Did you see correctly?

592
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:40,720
Is it that person!

593
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,180
That's right.

594
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:48,410
That guy that came for community service.

595
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,870
Why is that hard?

596
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:05,440
Just argue that you need the CCTV because some person scratched your car and you need to find that person.

597
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:09,040
Just as much as there are people wanting to be trusted there are no guilty people.

598
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:13,270
There is nothing wrong with not trusting black haired animals.

599
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,590
You stay here.

600
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:22,830
It was last January right?

601
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:34,580
She didn't come?

602
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:37,850
It seems she filed a sick day at the restaurant.

603
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:41,370
Where is she sick?

604
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:43,280
That...

605
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,050
Go find out.

606
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:49,840
Why?

607
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:52,380
Nothing.

608
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:07,550
<i>I also have something to confirm. </i>

609
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:14,490
<i>Yesterday, that supermarket next to the railroad, </i>

610
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:19,220
<i>The woman said she saw you. </i>

611
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,860
<i>The day that dad disappeared. </i>

612
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:26,190
<i>She said you took him. </i>

613
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:41,000
<i>It that true?</i>

614
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:45,930
<i> Lies.</i>

615
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:51,300
<i> Oppa, you don't know how to lie.</i>

616
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:18,900
<i>Dad, how did this happen?</i>

617
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:26,000
<i> Dad!</i>

618
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:34,590
<i>In case. If Dad goes out alone, it's dangerous.</i>

619
00:56:34,590 --> 00:56:37,500
<i>I filed his information already.</i>

620
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:41,280
<i>This was made so that he cannot take it off himself. </i>

621
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:14,980
<i>Where is the house for you to not come? </i>

622
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:16,560
<i>Let's go to Yoo Jeong. </i>

623
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:20,460
<i>Yes, Yoo Jeong is waiting for you. Let's get in. </i>

624
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,840
<i> Do you remember this?</i>

625
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:31,080
<i>Why would I not remember?</i>

626
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:36,950
<i>You were the one driving but let Yoo Jeong take the blame. Do you think I would not know that? </i>

627
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:32,280
<i>♫ Would it be alright if I move closer</i>

628
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:39,040
<i>♫ I was scared so I stood still</i>

629
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:45,960
<i>♫ Did we really have to meet</i>

630
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:50,970
<i>♫ I can't give an answer</i>

631
00:58:50,970 --> 00:58:58,500
<i>♫ Because unerasable scar hurts</i>

632
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:05,220
<i>♫ Would I be able to tell you again that 
I love you</i>

633
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:11,920
<i>♫ No matter how many times I let you go, 
you're still the one</i>
