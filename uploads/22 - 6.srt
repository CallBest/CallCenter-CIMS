<i>Secret</i>

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,200
What is this?

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,750
Just what are you?

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,950
Owner of this building.

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,450
Such an evil karma, isn't it.

6
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,160
I never sold this place.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,800
Get out of our house immediately.

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,300
I don't want to be here either.

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,470
I'll let you slide up until this week, 
so know when to get out.

10
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,800
Or, I'm forcing you out.

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,100
On who's account?

12
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,450
This is my house where I lived my whole life.
You have no right.

13
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,230
Just why do you keep following me and torment me?

14
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,620
Who are you? Why are you doing this?

15
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,850
How degenerate do you have to be, 
to do something like this to a human being?

16
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:46,200
How can a human being 
do this to another human being?

17
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:52,100
What you did... Was that something 
that can be done to a human being?

18
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,550
How did it feel to abandon and leave 
a dying person on the street?

19
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,840
This lousy building? This is nothing.

20
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,700
Compared to what you took away from me!

21
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,110
You only have this week.

22
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,350
It'll be best if I never see you again.

23
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,080
Are you done crying?

24
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,650
Did you come to watch, or to sympathize?

25
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,990
Both.

26
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,020
If we had heard the song until the end, 
it would have been better.

27
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,980
There's this saying...

28
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,140
Because of the person who wouldn't cry for you... 
Don't cry.

29
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,580
Wipe your tears.

30
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:42,130
And... 
Because of the person who would cry for you, Se Yeon... Cry.

31
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,080
What should I do with the building?

32
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,200
Should I take care of it?

33
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,400
Don't touch it. Just leave it.

34
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,900
Now, following around Kang Yoo Jeong, too... Stop that.

35
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,320
Yes.

36
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,950
It's annoying.

37
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,640
<i>Substitute, was it you?</i>

38
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,540
<i>You can't hit a person... and just leave.</i>

39
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:52,890
<i>The likes of your kind 
dare touch something of mine?</i>

40
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,520
<i>For something like this... Don't act all so scared!</i>

41
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,660
<i>Why are you doing this? 
Following me all the way here! . .</i>

42
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,810
<i>Why are you doing this to me?</i>

43
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,800
<i>Stay comfortably while you're inside.</i>

44
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,540
<i>Because when you come out, 
it will become very uncomfortable.</i>

45
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,320
Yoo Jeong.

46
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,840
Yoo Jeong.

47
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,850
Oppa.

48
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,050
What happened?

49
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,250
No. It's nothing.

50
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,030
Look at me. Did you get hurt?

51
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,160
I think I have to move out of the house.

52
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,830
The building owner came by.

53
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,690
He told me to move out this week.

54
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,370
If he tells you to move out suddenly like this...

55
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,630
I'll talk to him.

56
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,650
No.

57
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,050
I'll take care of it. Don't worry about it.

58
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:41,800
Still...

59
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,050
He is a difficult person to talk to.

60
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,400
Let me talk to someone like that.

61
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,280
Please let me do that.

62
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:59,320
It is true that I am in debt.

63
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,740
What are you doing here?

64
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:33,380
I don't know... what I'm doing here, either.

65
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,610
Aren't you going home?

66
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,150
Go home for what? There's nothing there to do.

67
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,680
Did something happen?

68
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,030
Something?

69
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,860
It's because of you going up on stage, right?

70
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,150
You've had stage fright since you were little.

71
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,910
Mighty Shin Se Yeon, who was she trying to lobby...

72
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:09,700
that she even thought of singing on stage?

73
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,900
Jo Min Hyeok.

74
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,430
I didn't go up there for others.

75
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,610
It was you whom I sang for.

76
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,830
What you wanted to give to me, 
was this it?

77
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:38,070
You already have everything so I didn't have anything to give you.

78
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,420
I at least wanted to sing for you.

79
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,880
Then, you should have told me in advance.

80
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,960
It was wrong timing...

81
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,700
I want to leave. I'm tired.

82
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,350
Se Yeon.

83
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,950
Then, can't you sing now?

84
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,530
Ultimately, I'm the only one who has to hear.

85
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,950
Jo Min Hyeok. You...

86
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,950
Could you shed tears for me?

87
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,490
I'm saying, could you cry for me?

88
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,860
Why are you like this?

89
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,400
Unlike Shin Se Yeon, suddenly.

90
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,430
I want to stop now.

91
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,270
What?

92
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,000
This marriage...

93
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,130
I'm not going to do it.

94
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,800

<i>Compared to what you took away from me!</i>

100
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,150
Dad.

101
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,200
We have to go.

102
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,200
Should we go traveling?

103
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,400
Mountain or ocean, should we go see them?

104
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,730
Ocean?

105
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,370
Mm.

106
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,340
Let's go traveling.

107
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,700
Right, ocean.

108
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,650
Let's go.

109
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,540
Can you take this off of me? It's itchy.

110
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,300
No. You have to keep it on.

111
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:32,400
Take it off!

112
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,120

113
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,530
Dad! Dad!

114
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:46,280
Dad!

115
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,780
Dad!

116
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,660

117
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,690
Forty five...

118
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,010
forty six...

119
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,050
forty seven.

120
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:01,480
When I was your age, I couldn't pinch my stomach.

121
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,050
I was tight.

122
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,400
Mom!

123
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,240
Do five more.

124
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,630
Having inborn capabilities do not matter. 
Whether you manage it or not,

125
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,430
that's what determines the victory or defeat.

126
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:17,920
If I took after you, I wouldn't have to work hard like this...

127
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,270
why did I take after dad?

128
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,950
You're right.

129
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,010
It would have been so great. Mm?

130
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,750
Now that I've had a chance to look, Mom, 
I don't think we have anything resembling.

131
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,010
We have different tastes in food, 
different body types, too.

132
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:40,760
My friends also say the same thing. 
That we don't look alike at all.

133
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,860
Mom, by any chance...

134
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,920
Yes?

135
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,410
Tell me the truth. I'm a not a kid anymore.

136
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:49,340
What?

137
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:53,630
Mom, which parts did you fix?

138
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:01,030
This kid! This is not a fixed face.

139
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,850
Not a lot anyway...

140
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,530
Come on, which part did you fix?

141
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,390
Tell me.

142
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,650
Okay. Okay. It's the eyes.

143
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:10,930
I don't think so.

144
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,220
Se Yeon, that day...

145
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,160
Please come in.

146
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:35,180
What is this? You said you didn't want to get married.

147
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,980
This is not marriage.

148
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,680
It's business.

149
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,360
That's a down payment. This is a contract.

150
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,010
I already signed it.

151
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:54,180
This is the Lucida diamond ring, cut in the year 99.

152
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:59,120
Princess cutting that emphasizes the brightness...

153
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,290
I don't know much about that. 
Which is the most expensive one here?

154
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,300
You want that one?

155
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,670
That's it?

156
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,900
Why? It looks big enough.

157
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:14,510
If it's big, the biggest one in the world. 
If it's expensive, the most expensive one.

158
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:19,800
Or... Choose a ring that you really want to give me.

159
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:28,190
What you want to give me... Do you have none?

160
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,700
Hey, the ring is...

161
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,050
Please wrap that one for us.

162
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,160
Because the down payment, the more the better.

163
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,670
I think you might even ask for a breach of contract fee.

164
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,980
Of course.

165
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,950
It's all written here. Read it well.

166
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:53,130
What responsibility the party that reneges first will bear.

167
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:59,600
If I give you the down payment, what are you going to give me in return?

168
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,640
Just by me standing beside you, your worth will go up.

169
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,400
Hey, Shin Se Yeon, you...

170
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,180
The ring. I'll accept it.

171
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:30,480
Of course the apple won't fall far from the tree!

172
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,940
That family is second to none 
when it comes to managing their profit.

173
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,420
You know Se Yeon isn't like that.

174
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,700
What you mean she isn't like that?

175
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,520
From grade school, Se Yeon is my childhood friend.

176
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,010
A friend?

177
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:42,720
You... Don't say things like that casually.

178
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,640
You have to fall in the water together

179
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,190
to know who your real friends are.

180
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:53,900
Review (the contract) and send it back after revising
the part that is unfavorable to us.

181
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,620
Yes.

182
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,270
Kang Yoo Jeong. Did she leave?

183
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,390
She has to get out by this week.

184
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:15,090
Last time, you told me not to follow her anymore.

185
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,290
Hey!

186
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:22,000
Even if you don't follow her, you're supposed to know where she is!

187
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm sorry.

188
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,570
I don't want to eat anymore.

189
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:34,790
Even so, how dare you come here?

190
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:39,010
Even if Do Hoon says to come here, 
you barge in here with your sick dad as an excuse?

191
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,540
- Mother-in-law. 
- Hey, hey.

192
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,390
If other people hear you they're going to misunderstand.

193
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:46,320
Why am I your mother. We're strangers now.

194
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,140
I'm sorry, Mo...

195
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:55,070
I also know I shouldn't be visiting like this, but

196
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:58,140
my dad can't sleep well in strange places.

197
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:01,240
- Dad! 
 - Omo!

198
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,290
Shoes.

199
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,550
That's why you should have been preparing already...

200
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,490
How many times have do I have to tell you...

201
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:12,370
You need to get your head straight! Haven't I told you that?

202
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:17,040
We only have 2 rooms. Where will we have him sleep?

203
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,980
Do Hoon said he'd be late.

204
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,700
Have your dad go into Do Hoon's room.

205
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,170
Thank you so much, Father-in-law.

206
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:29,580
Father-in-law my butt.

207
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,720
Thank you.

208
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:45,060
Dad, it's alright.

209
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:50,440
Hard and complicated things... I will take care of it all.

210
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:09,750
You're leaving?

211
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,790
Yes, Sunbaenim.

212
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,900
I've clearly given you the advice.

213
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:14,600
Yes?

214
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,980
I have no personal feelings about this, 
so don't blame me.

215
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:22,130
This is an organization. And I'm a member of that organization.

216
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:26,830
I'll see you next week at the Supreme Court.

217
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,320
<i>Supreme Prosecutors Office 
Court Summons for Prosecutor Ahn Do Hoon</i>

218
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,330
This is a favor I got by agreeing to share a meal with the manager here,

219
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,900
so you have to do well.

220
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,900
Thank you, Hye Ri.

221
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:18,550
Kwang Soo, it came off.

222
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,960
Yes.

223
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:40,470
Let's go.

224
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,880
Our President is so young.

225
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,330
Isn't he daebak?

226
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,640
What's wrong?

227
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,260
Why?

228
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:11,280
Come here quickly!

229
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,540
There's an empty spot here.

230
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:17,720
This is where you'll do your work.

231
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,310
<i> Why did you do that?</i>

232
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,840
<i> Unni stop it! That's enough!</i>

233
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,350
<i> Let go!</i>

234
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,470
<i>I've got this!</i>

235
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,450
Sorry.

236
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:18,510
I don't think I'm suitable to work here.

237
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,540
I'm sorry Hye Ri. You helped me so much.

238
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:53,150
<i> 2nd Floor.</i>

239
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:03,230
I've told you not to appear in front of me again...

240
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:06,050
Now you've entered my boundary?

241
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:11,360
Yes, ahjumoni.

242
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,440
Again?

243
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,570
No, I'll be there right away.

244
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:19,610
Sorry.

245
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,620
Why is she going up?

246
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,560
She's coming. She's coming.

247
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:45,270
Should I follow her?

248
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,320
No. That's fine.

249
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,190
I'm tired from attending an early meeting.

250
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,690
Let's go.

251
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:00,670
I'm so sorry.

252
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,020
I'm sorry, Ahjumma.

253
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,840
I'm sorry.

254
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:12,450
Dad. Why did you come here again?

255
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:16,160
Yoo Jeong, open the door. It's locked.

256
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,210
This is not our home anymore. Let's go home.

257
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:21,360
Open the door.

258
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,820
Next time,

259
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,540
let's come back here again, okay?

260
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:28,730
Your mother didn't like sweets at first.

261
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,790
She became this way because

262
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:35,060
she kept eating the bread I baked again and again.

263
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:38,400
She really liked creme filled pastry.

264
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,410
Dad!

265
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,420
Dad! Dad!

266
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,020
Dad!

267
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,200
Can you see that his vessels have swollen?

268
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,880
It's urgent that we conduct the operation that pinches
the cerebral artery right here.

269
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,140
Ah, we've made provisions by administering drugs, but

270
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,620
just think of it as a time bomb residing inside his head.

271
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,710
If he has the surgery he'll be okay, right?

272
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,680
Post surgery, we have to keep watching to see.

273
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,440
Please let him have the surgery.

274
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,070
Doctor.

275
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,560
Please save my dad.

276
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:21,920
Let's go home!! I'm not taking it off!

277
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,080
If my dad continues to be stubborn, he's going to pass out again.

278
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,800
Dad, let's take this off just once.

279
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,250
No way! Go away!!

280
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:37,400
Dad, take it off!

281
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:42,110
If you don't put this on, I'm going to 
send you back to the nursing home!

282
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,430
Wear this.

283
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,550
Wear. Hand!

284
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:09,370
<i> Whoa... Take this as a collateral.</i>

285
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:12,250
<i> Keep it safe. I'll be coming to take it back.</i>

286
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,800
I'm a Special Prosecutor Park Hyeon Seok.

287
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:33,520
Assemblyman Kim Chang Seok stated a suspicion 
that the Prosecutions Office had conducted entrapment.

288
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,260
At this office, regarding this statement,

289
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:40,760
we're going to investigate to determine the truth.

290
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:44,230
You have submitted your motive of investigation, 
have you not?

291
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,730
Yes.

292
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:55,350
Prosecutor Ahn Do Hoon.

293
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,090
Can you spare a moment of your time?

294
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,450
This will become your spot.

295
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:29,830
This is Assemblyman Kim's overseas account information.

296
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,120
What is the reason you're handing this over?

297
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:37,840
Why don't you come work at the K-Group headquarters?

298
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,610
And think of this (information) as kind of a
contractual deposit.

299
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,600
Do I look easy to you?

300
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,320
You don't seem easy, but

301
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,680
desperate.

302
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:56,200
Put cuffs on Assemblyman Kim once again and

303
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:59,590
just take off your suit refreshingly! (quit your job)

304
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,680
Dad!

305
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:12,150
Doctor!

306
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:14,710
- My head! Ouch!
- Someone hold him!

307
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:15,520
Please stop moving.

308
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,650
Hold him please.

309
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:19,000
Open your eyes!

310
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,920
Please move aside, guardian.

311
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:34,180
Man, when do we finish all these? We're going to work
through the night again.

312
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,080
Team Leader Kim.

313
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,150
If you give me the account's receipts and 
communication records...

314
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:41,990
The boss told us not to give you anything while
 you're being investigated.

315
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:44,430
He said not to give you any work.

316
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:24,150
It's a face that says that something's not going well.

317
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,630
What brings you here?

318
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,250
I used it well.

319
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,330
Did you come here to give back a handkerchief?

320
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:45,640
If I said that I was here to return your handkerchief,

321
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,010
that would seem like an excuse. .

322
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:55,240
I don't know why I came here.

323
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,770
I just wanted to drink alcohol and insult people.

324
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:02,490
Suddenly I thought of you.

325
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:05,700
I'm not a person with that much free time.

326
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,950
Each day I have thousands of cases to go through, and...

327
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,480
Mr. Prosecutor!

328
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,510
The boss told you to go home since you don't have anything to do.

329
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,050
How much can you give me for it?

330
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,190
How much did you pay for it?

331
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:30,510
It was a gift.

332
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:35,190
The craftsmanship is really well done and the
 condition isn't bad...

333
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,420
Please give me as much as you possibly can.

334
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,990
Later, I'll definitely come back to retrieve it.

335
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:49,020
Please just book the surgery date.

336
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,300
I will pay the rest later.

337
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:00,820
Ms. Kang Yoo Jeong!

338
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,880
Yes?

339
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,310
What is it?

340
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,980
Let go of me, please.

341
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:12,590
Why are you doing this?

342
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:20,290
The ring I had made to give to my daughter-in-law,

343
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,900
is in your hands? Why is that?

344
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:28,480
Do you have any idea how much this is?

345
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:34,040
You hand over a $150K ring at $4K?

346
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,330
Why didn't you just wear it yourself?

347
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:41,890
You can't sell it anywhere, as it has a unique product identifier.

348
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:45,370
Have you never thought to find the owner, given its value?

349
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:47,210
I'm sorry.

350
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:52,260
I asked to see you because I thought maybe my son found another woman.

351
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:55,250
But I don't think that's the case.

352
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:59,200
Notify the police and hand her over.

353
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,270
That ring... I'm the one who gave it to her.

354
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,360
Let's go.

355
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,070
Get up.

356
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,170
Get up.

357
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:28,220
I told you it would be wise not to appear in front of me again.

358
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:32,380
How low are you to sell another person's belonging?

359
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:36,170
I... will make sure to pay you back.

360
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:38,450
Easier said than done.

361
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:42,880
My dad is sick and I needed money for his surgery.

362
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,540
I knew it was wrong, but

363
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:49,020
I must have lost my mind for a moment.

364
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:52,170
Your old father?

365
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:54,710
Must be nice to have many excusable things.

366
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:58,060
Sorry! I'm really sorry.

367
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,720
Don't say sorry.

368
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,560
I don't need an apology that you wear on your mouth.

369
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,730
Feel the pain as much as me.

370
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:10,820
Try losing the most precious people, 
without having a chance to do anything.

371
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:15,970
How pathetically painful that is, 
shouldn't you feel it too? Huh?

372
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:19,380
Get out. See you at the police station.

373
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,760
Get out!

374
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:49,300
I'm sorry.

375
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,990
Hey!

376
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:56,050
Please save me just once!

377
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:59,640
I can't let my dad go like this.

378
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,280
Put me in the police station.

379
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,190
I'll go to jail. I'll take punishment.

380
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:06,380
My dad getting the surgery and smiling,

381
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:10,330
please let me go after I see just that, 
I'm begging you!

382
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:12,490
This time...

383
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:15,870
If you just let me watch my dad by his side...

384
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:19,810
Hey! Get off of me!

385
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:21,640
Aren't you even embarrassed?

386
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,550
No, I'm not embarrassed.

387
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:27,490
I can do even worse things.

388
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,650
What I'm embarrassed of...

389
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:36,240
is what I had done 
to that person who passed away.

390
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:41,780
I don't think I've paid off my sins.

391
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:44,040
For my whole life...

392
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:48,710
For my whole life, I will never forget it. 
How can I forget?

393
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:51,450
Don't speak of it carelessly.

394
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:56,920
I said don't speak of it carelessly.

395
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:05,850
I'm sorry.

396
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:10,090
Okay.

397
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:11,940
So what do you want to do?

398
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:15,380
If I give you the chance to save your father,

399
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:18,770
what will you do for me?

400
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,970
As you can see, I have a lot of money.

401
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:28,470
That surgery fee, I can lend it to you too.

402
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,980
Se Yeon.

403
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,520
What are you doing here?

404
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,080
What do you mean?

405
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,710
I wanted to insult someone while drinking alcohol.

406
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,160
Who is this?

407
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:58,550
Someone that came to see me.

408
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:04,070
Say hi to her. My friend Shin Se Yeon.

409
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,610
And there... Prosecutor Ahn Do Hoon.

410
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:32,560
If you're going to drink, do you want to do it together?

411
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,100
We were going to drink anyways.

412
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,440
Okay then.

413
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,140
Where should we go?

414
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:40,450
And we have someone precious, too.

415
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:44,630
Oh right... 
I'll deposit the money into your account tomorrow.

416
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:53,610
Okay. Thank you.

417
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:56,920
I'll go now.

418
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,090
Don't go.

419
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:06,710
I told you not to go.

420
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:09,280
I even did what you were asking.

421
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,630
Se Yeon, I feel today...

422
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,620
Are you trying to run away?

423
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:21,790
Were you originally weak on alcohol?

424
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:24,290
Still, you shouldn't run away.

425
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:25,990
As a man.

426
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:54,300
I know this is awkward since it was so sudden.

427
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,340
But,

428
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,640
have we met before?

429
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,660
No.

430
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,970
Prosecutor Ahn, I'm hurt.

431
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:07,640
You've always refused, when I asked you to drink.

432
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,670
What do you do?

433
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,420
Min Hyeok...

434
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:19,360
How do you know him?

435
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,840
Personal friendship.

436
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,970
What I ask her to do... This and that, 
she takes care of them.

437
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,650
Do Hoon.

438
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:33,750
Are you tense because a woman is next to you?

439
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,050
Why aren't you saying anything?

440
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:38,420
I feel uncomfortable, since this was unexpected.

441
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:41,910
We should quickly introduce Prosecutor Ahn to some ladies.

442
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:45,280
I heard there is a problem 
when someone doesn't date for too long.

443
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,970
How do you feel about Prosecutor Ahn?

444
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:49,290
He's still single, isn't he handsome?

445
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,070
Jo Min Hyeok!

446
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:54,900
I have... a boyfriend.

447
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:00,650
Is that so?

448
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:03,560
What does your boyfriend do?

449
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:06,930
Just...

450
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:13,960
He is a person who is doing great work.

451
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,600
Great work?

452
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,400
I need to go to the bathroom.

453
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,700
Have you known Min Hyeok for a long time?

454
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:45,710
Min Hyeok and I are expected to get married...

455
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,730
did you know?

456
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,750
No. Please don't misunderstand.

457
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:57,490
The boss...

458
00:37:57,490 --> 00:38:00,250
he is just a good person that is lending me money for my dad's surgery.

459
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,270
That's it.

460
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,540
This isn't my place to come.

461
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:10,340
That this isn't your place to come...

462
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:12,210
as long as you know it.

463
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:14,360
I'll leave first.

464
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:27,160
What are you doing?

465
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,390
I'm not doing anything.

466
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,660
That woman came to me on her own, and...

467
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:34,390
said she needed money for her father's surgery, 
so what can I do?

468
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:38,370
Letting aside any hate, 
I have to save who needs to be saved.

469
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:42,660
Because unlike someone, 
I don't turn against a human life.

470
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:47,140
Kang Yoo Jeong, isn't she really thick-skinned?

471
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:49,650
She recognized you, right?

472
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:52,440
The prosecutor who convicted her is right next to her,

473
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,700
but she didn't even flinch.

474
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,510
Using money to capture the woman 
who is done paying for her sins,

475
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:14,050
Isn't that too low?

476
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:18,910
I didn't know you would 
support Kang Yoo Jeong this much.

477
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:21,460
Kang Yoo Jeong...

478
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,610
is no longer a defendant.

479
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:27,020
She's simply a normal woman 
who has gone through the legal system.

480
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:30,650
What are you talking about?

481
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:35,320
It's uncomfortable to stay here any longer.

482
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,930
With money...

483
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:42,560
and power, you think you can move people.

484
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,740
This kind of ties, it's repulsive.

485
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:00,700
That woman, is she the one that killed Seo Ji Hee?

486
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:03,960
I'm sorry.

487
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:05,910
The truth is...

488
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:07,440
Jo Min Hyeok!

489
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,690
You're not really hurt.

490
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:15,210
You're just whining to let people see you're hurting.

491
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:18,160
If you keep being like this...

492
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,660
I can't marry you.

493
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:26,060
If you think this marriage is a business,

494
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:31,200
you should at least keep the minimum courtesy 
for your partner.

495
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,770
Do you know where Kang Woo Cheol is?

496
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:02,050
I haven't seen him.

497
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,740
What have you been running around doing?

498
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,750
Did you go see that man because you need money?

499
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:37,410
Do you know who he is...? 
- Oppa!

500
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,360
I can't find Dad. He's not at the hospital.

501
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:45,290
He's not at the bakery either, 
even though he always goes there.

502
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:48,200
What are you saying?
- Dad isn't here!

503
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,410
Maybe he went to Mom's grave?

504
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:53,150
He goes there often. I need to go there! 
Let go of this.

505
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:55,200
Yoo Jeong. 
- He is not here!

506
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,870
I'll look for him, so calm down!

507
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:59,180
How can I calm down when my Dad's not here?

508
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:02,340
I already got his surgery date! I need to find him!

509
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:05,240
For now, go to the police station 
and report missing person first.

510
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,600
I'll look for him.

511
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:43,980
Ahjussi.

512
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:47,510
Please find my Dad.

513
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,910
Because he needs to get a surgery right now, 
we need to find him quickly.

514
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:53,350
Please calm down and

515
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:55,660
fill the missing person's form out.

516
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,260
Father.

517
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,990
I can't quite figure out which way is home. 
Lets go to Yoo Kyeong and Yoo Jeong.

518
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:22,870
Yes, Yoo Jeong is waiting for you. 
Get in quickly.

519
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,500
It's a relief.

520
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,990
Be careful driving.

521
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:41,300
Yes, Father-in-law.

522
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,710
You're just talk.

523
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:47,490
Last time you cracked open Yoo Jeong's forehead.

524
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:51,260
Even then I was...

525
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:55,150
worried because it was raining so hard.

526
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:59,630
When I saw Yoo Jeong dreaming about fixing her car...

527
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:02,420
The car was so damaged...

528
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:06,600
I had thought it was a relief that 
only her forehead was cracked open.

529
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:09,820
That...

530
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:12,190
do you remember that?

531
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:16,090
Why would I not remember?

532
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:18,390
You were the one driving,

533
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:21,710
but you put the blame on my Yoo Jeong. 
Do you think I don't know that?

534
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,830
If you do that again this time,

535
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,030
I won't just let it go.

536
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:42,340
Okay, Son-in-law Han?

537
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:45,620
Seat belt.

538
00:44:58,010 --> 00:45:00,340
Be careful.

539
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:02,790
Be careful driving.

540
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:37,190
Okay, that's enough for today.

541
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:41,310
Good job for today.

542
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:49,070
Let's see each other again at ten tomorrow, 
Prosecutor Ahn Do Hoon.

543
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:56,230
Is it this kind of thing you meant 
what you said about your belief?

544
00:45:56,230 --> 00:46:00,510
In order to keep your belief in the organization, 
that you have to know how to bend.

545
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:04,450
I didn't know it meant stepping over the Hoobae like this.

546
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:07,690
Rather, that I don't need the truth or the belief!

547
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:11,400
Getting ahead in life is all. 
Why didn't you tell me that?

548
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,380
Prosecutor Ahn,

549
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:18,220
Having an illusion that you're the only person of justice, 
isn't there a problem with that?

550
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:23,110
How you got the Assemblyman Kim's file, 
there is something I heard about that.

551
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:28,650
Only for the truth and justice, 
you had Assemblyman Kim apprehended?

552
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:30,430
That's not it.

553
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:35,200
Having a high profile crime figure under your belt, 
you wanted to get ahead in your career...

554
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,990
Do you have enough confidence to deny it?

555
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,100
<i>Please find my dad </i>

556
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,160
Yes?

557
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:09,870
Yes?

558
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:14,660
Yes, yes, a red jacket.

559
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:20,950
Yes, that's right.

560
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:23,220
Where are you?

561
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,890
Huh?

562
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,230
Po Hang?

563
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:37,690
Uhhh...

564
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:41,180
For overlooking the ring incident...

565
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:43,490
Thank you.

566
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,600
Even if it takes my whole life,

567
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,750
I'll pay you back somehow. 
Because I have an urgent matter right now...

568
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:51,580
I'm sorry.

569
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:56,990
Please be nice...

570
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,140
They found my dad.

571
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:00,610
Where?

572
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:02,690
Po Hang.

573
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,000
Ahhh, so annoying.

574
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,770
Taxi!

575
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:16,190
You said Po Hang.

576
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,490
Dad!

577
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,420
Dad.

578
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:48,540
Dad. I'm sorry. What do I do, Dad? 
Dad!

579
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:52,930
Dad. Dad! Dad...

580
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:06,480
Dad. Dad...

581
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:12,020
<i>Please give us a word.</i>

582
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:13,700
<i>This investigation...</i>

583
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:16,730
<i>as a typical Prosecution's external-pressure Investigation,</i>

584
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:19,270
<i>that fact that it was an attempt to end my political life,</i>

585
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:22,780
<i>has been clearly revealed.</i>

586
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,400
<i>By shedding the misunderstanding thus far,</i>

587
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:30,000
<i>I'm planning on reinstating myself back to
to the folds of my political party.</i>

588
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:48,160
Thank you for coming here as soon as you came out.

589
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,600
It's not like there was anyone waiting for me.

590
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,700
<i>Funeral for Kang Woo Cheol. 
 Survived by daughter Kang Yoo Jeong.</i>

591
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:53,780
Hey, hey, that's not needed.

592
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:55,700
Do I need to tell everybody I got out?

593
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:58,500
It's laughable. If you eat that (Tofu), do you become innocent?

594
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:12,440
Not bad.

595
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:15,530
There's someone who'd cry on your behalf and all.

596
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:17,020
Did you find a place to stay?

597
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:18,280
You crazy bitch.

598
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,200
Is this time for you to worry about me?

599
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,920
It'd be easy enough for me to get settled.

600
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,000
If it's that difficult, YOU can come and see ME, wench.

601
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:32,650
<i>♫ Even though I reach out my hand</i>

602
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:35,620
<i>♫ There is no use 
Why?</i>

603
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:38,200
Is there someone you're waiting for?

604
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:43,030
<i>♫ After the love ended</i>

605
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,900
It really gets on my nerves.

606
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,500
You always smile like that 
when you're having a hard time.

607
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:58,700
<i>♫ Where you had stayed, 
there were only tears</i>

608
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,700
<i>Grave of surname Kang, Woo Cheol &amp; 
surname Kim Mi Yeong (mother).</i>

609
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:06,700
<i>♫ And they disappear away</i>

610
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:13,200
<i>♫ Although it hurts, 
I live on without crying</i>

611
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:20,600
<i>♫ It's me who finally says I love you</i>

612
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:24,300
<i>♫ The words I didn't know back then</i>

613
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,800
<i>♫ The words I didn't want to hear</i>

614
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,300
<i>♫ Inside your flowing tears</i>

615
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:37,100
<i>♫ The fact I have lived there</i>

616
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:42,400
<i>♫ If I had also known it back then</i>

617
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,050
Take this.

618
00:52:45,050 --> 00:52:47,180
It's all that I have.

619
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:54,870
I feel I have to do at least this,

620
00:52:54,870 --> 00:52:58,070
to feel more at ease.

621
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:03,690
I thought a lot

622
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:07,380
while staying at the funeral parlor alone.

623
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:10,100
"When will Oppa come?"

624
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:11,970
"Will he be here today?"

625
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:14,350
"Would he be here in the early morning?"

626
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:19,730
I waited and waited for you, but you wouldn't come.

627
00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:26,300
But when I thought about it,

628
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:29,650
if you were to have come the first day,

629
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:33,290
I would have been so busy holding and leaning on to you,

630
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:39,750
that I would not have been able to send off my dad very well.

631
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:43,580
Yoo Jeong.

632
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:46,810
If you had come the second day,

633
00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:51,490
I would have been so busy hating and blaming you
for coming late,

634
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:55,010
and not have been able to think of my dad much.

635
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:01,800
So, thank you.

636
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,990
Coming today (at the right time).

637
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:09,950
It's fine that I got to see your face like this.

638
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:13,610
I'm sorry.

639
00:54:13,610 --> 00:54:15,560
Oppa,

640
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:22,000
let's just end... the things we're sorry for.

641
00:54:28,370 --> 00:54:30,810
All the while, we've...

642
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:33,230
worked so hard.

643
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:35,000
Don't you think?

644
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:35,820
Yoo Jeong.

645
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:39,230
We were so worried per chance we'd cause each other pain,

646
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:43,310
so we just laughed things off.

647
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:47,700
This isn't right, you know.

648
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:49,800
If we meet like this,

649
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:53,380
you'd once again feel guilty.

650
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:57,020
And that guilt would cause you to want to do something for me.

651
00:54:57,020 --> 00:55:00,170
And I would feel burdened and try to figure out how I should behave.

652
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:04,450
It'll be repetitious (vicious cycle).

653
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:10,170
But the thing I did (gone to jail for him),

654
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:14,650
I will never regret it.

655
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:19,480
Even if that situation arises again,

656
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:22,480
I will make the same decision.

657
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:26,410
So, stop feeling sorry.

658
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:32,080
What is there

659
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:36,640
that I could do for you?

660
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:54,930
Help me leave first.

661
00:55:57,430 --> 00:56:00,630
The memory of someone's appearance from behind

662
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:04,110
is supposed to last for a very long time.

663
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:08,460
I think it'd be difficult

664
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:11,390
to see your appearance from the back.

665
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:15,210
I'm not confident.

666
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:34,540
My dad...

667
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:39,180
I never got to buy you a nice pair of shoes.

668
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:13,840
I shouldn't have made an excuse of being busy.

669
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:17,990
I should have gone together

670
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:22,220
when he asked to see foliage together.

671
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:28,470
I should have listen to his stories more.

672
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:32,660
I should have told him even more stories next to him.

673
00:58:48,810 --> 00:58:52,020
The breads you baked for me

674
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:55,230
were really delicious.

675
00:58:58,550 --> 00:59:02,630
They were the most delicious in the world.

676
00:59:21,370 --> 00:59:24,740
I shouldn't have washed this coat.

677
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:27,900
So it'd smell of Dad more.

678
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:41,980
Daddy.

679
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:46,000
Daddy.

680
00:59:58,890 --> 01:00:00,850
Dad,

681
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,870
be born as my child

682
01:00:03,870 --> 01:00:07,510
in your next life.

683
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:10,530
I will be your dad.

684
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:16,520
So I can return all

685
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:21,870
that I have received from you.

686
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:31,480
What should I do, Dad?!

687
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:36,180
What do I do now?

688
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:50,800
Dad, what do I do?!

689
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:56,690
How about Kang Yoo Jeong?

690
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:59,020
I couldn't tell her whereabouts for several days now.

691
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:01,140
Find her.

692
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:01,760
Yes, sir.

693
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,870
Ah, never mind.

694
01:01:03,870 --> 01:01:06,340
Finding a person is a piece of cake for you.

695
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:19,150
Substitute driver!

696
01:02:19,150 --> 01:02:20,620
Hey, substitute driver!

697
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:25,200
Hey! Get a hold of yourself!

698
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,560
Get a hold of yourself!

699
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:48,280
Wake up!

700
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:51,200
Wake up!!

701
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:56,500
♫ <i> Would it be okay if I were to follow.</i> ♫

702
01:02:57,860 --> 01:03:04,580
♫<i> I'm holding still for fear of it.</i> ♫

703
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:09,300
♫ <i>Should we really have met?</i> ♫

704
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:11,200
Over here!

705
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,840
Over here!!

706
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:16,400
- A person is dying.
- Please come this way.

707
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:23,570
<i>♫ The scar I can't erase has become pained. ♫</i>

708
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:30,700
<i>♫ Would I be able to say I love once again? ♫</i>

709
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:37,520
<i>♫ I abandon you over and again, 
but still you're there again. ♫</i>

710
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:44,430
<i>♫ No matter how hard I try to erase you, 
like an incurable disease ♫</i>

 I just can't stop this love</i> ♫

01:03:51,530 --> 01:03:55,960
<i>♫ I walk on the same street as I did that day
In the lost memories, ♫</i>

713
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:58,540
<i>♫ to the door where I see you ♫</i>

714
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:01,340
<i>♫ If you are standing in the lost time ♫</i>

715
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:05,300
<i>♫ Please don't move, don't try to forget me ♫</i>

716
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:07,050
<i> ♫ The stopped time is ticking away through you again ♫ </i>

717
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:08,900
Don't die.

718
01:04:10,190 --> 01:04:12,550
Without my permission...

719
01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:15,250
Absolutely, don't die.

720
01:04:15,850 --> 01:04:22,310
<i>♫ Will I be able to say I love you once again? ♫</i>

721
01:04:22,310 --> 01:04:28,630
<i>♫ I throw you out and throw you out,
 but in the end I'm filled up by you ♫ </i>
