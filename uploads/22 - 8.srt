<i>Secret</i>

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,900
Alright, hurry up and hit me once!

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,900
Isn't that why you followed me?

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,860
What bad luck is this

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,870
to meet you like this?

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,180
What if I hit you?

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,700
If I hit you, will San come back to life?

8
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,090
Then get hit! Get hit a hundred, a thousand times!

9
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,300
What are you talking about?

10
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,000
Take this!

11
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,900
Why are you like this? 
Why are you doing this to me?

12
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:37,600
Why are you like this?

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,490
You need to get hit. Get hit.

14
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:43,970
San? What about? 
Why is San coming back to life?

15
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,450
Why are you like this?

16
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,090
San...

17
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,140
he died.

18
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,020
<i>"Always on my side"</i>

19
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:15,610
Parole?

20
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,770
A kid who came in for theft

21
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,110
turned me in for some other thing.

22
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:30,150
As an additional punishment, 
I would have to serve another 3 years, but

23
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:33,590
I was told I just had to stop your parole.

24
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,700
He said if I start a small incident,

25
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,870
he'll forget that it ever happened.

26
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,120
I just did what I was told.

27
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:54,900
Unni... Have you ever done anyone wrong?

28
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,630
You're really nice so

29
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,750
I didn't know about anything else, but

30
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:11,850
I said a problem could arise because of the baby.

31
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:16,050
He said okay. 
He said they would take care of the aftermath.

32
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,890
It's the truth!

33
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,090
<i>Stay comfortable when you're inside,</i>

34
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,910
<i>because when you come out, 
it will become very uncomfortable</i>

35
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,880
<i>Try feeling the pain as much as me.</i>

36
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,650
<i>Try losing the most precious people, 
without a chance to do anything.</i>

37
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,190
<i>How pathetically painful it is, 
shouldn't you also feel it?</i>

38
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,560
Hey, substitute driver!

39
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,560
Where are you going at this time of night?

40
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,940
Who did you meet with?

41
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,010
Do I have to answer even that?

42
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:19,860
What?

43
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,560
It's true that I have a debt, but

44
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,330
that doesn't mean I have an obligation 
to report every single thing of my life.

45
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,770
Aigoo...

46
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,530
<i>Are you running away?</i>

47
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,850
<i>Were you originally weak on alcohol?</i>

48
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:48,070
<i>Still, you shouldn't run away. As a man.</i>

49
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:53,830
<i>Unlike someone, I don't turn my back on a human life.</i>

50
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,910
<i>Kang Yoo Jeong, isn't she really thick-skinned?</i>

51
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:01,650
<i>The prosecutor who convicted her is right next to her, but</i>

52
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,120
<i>she didn't even flinch.</i>

53
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:21,350
At that time, by chance... Was there another eyewitness?

54
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:25,510
Well, all investigative reports at that time,

55
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,360
we turned them over to the prosecution.

56
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,260
But, anyway, 
the hit-and-run incident from 4 years ago, why...

57
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:37,810
Possibly... That lady you guaranteed identity for, 
did she say something?

58
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,860
Right? Did she go to you and

59
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,740
say it was unfair to her?

60
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,840
If you remember anything, please give me a call.

61
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,060
Yes.

62
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,230
Wow, K-Group Legal Team Director...

63
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,420
Hold on,

64
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:56,580
I'm suddenly remembering something after seeing this, but

65
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,710
at that time someone who was either 
a witness or a reference person came,

66
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:04,230
and showed his K-Group business card like you did, and

67
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:07,420
asked me to call if I found out anything.

68
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,570
Who is that?

69
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,300
Hold on. There's going to be something here.

70
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,300
Oh, yes. This one.

71
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:20,750
Let's see.

72
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,450
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,600

00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,510
It's troublesome, Proscut...no Attorney Ahn.

78
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:20,150
You have to apply through the courts first in order to review the record!

79
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,660
Lawyer Ahn!

80
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,140
Section Leader Kim.

81
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,780
You said your son just got into K-Construction, right?

82
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,070
I understood that his original wish was to get a post 
at K-Hotel...

83
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,630
Then, please leave after you have looked.

84
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:18,230
<i>The CCTV here is such an old model that
the quality of images aren't good.</i>

85
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,550
<i>Identifying the driver is beyond its limitation,</i>

86
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,690
<i>I barely obtained the numbers (license plate).</i>

87
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,560

<i>Prosecutor. If the driver of the oncoming vehicle
were to have been photographed on the blackbox,</i>

90
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,720
<i>the suspect won't be able to insist any more...</i>

91
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,750
<i>But this car is a rental.</i>

92
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,130
<i>It'll be hard to find right?</i>

93
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,810
Ah Sunbaenim, you're here late.

94
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:55,980
Oh? What is someone who quit doing in someone else's office?

95
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,250
I came to see you, Sunbaenim.

96
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:04,940
The K-Group investigation case... 
When are you going to detonate it?

97
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,930
Even if the world is running at LTE level speed,

98
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,640
can you switch sides this fast?

99
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,060
Since when did you become the K-Group spokesperson?

100
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,800
I have corrupt accounting information on Chae Gyeong Group.

101
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,380
- If you stop the K Group investigation then...
- Now you're even making deals, eh?

102
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,740
Your legal gown (Prosecutor's) suited you so well...

103
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,140
You must really like the money.

104
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:36,900
Be careful. There's price to be paid for exceptional treatment.

105
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:43,040
Although Min Hyeok appears to be a rich kid 
born with silver spoon in his mouth,

106
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,820
taking after his dad, he has a scary side to him.

107
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,040
Yes, I will do my best.

108
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,060
You couldn't even sleep last night, why are you already here?

109
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,750
What could make you work so hard like this...

110
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,520
Drink it. You didn't even eat dinner yesterday.

111
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:26,000
Unni...our San...

112
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:29,790
If he had been born to a different mother,

113
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:33,610
who knows, he might still have been alive right now,

114
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:34,980
living happily.

115
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,700
You're saying things that don't make sense!

116
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,980
He's San because he came out of your stomach. 
If he had been born to someone else he'd be a stranger.

117
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,570
What is wrong with you?

118
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:48,990
I miss our San!

119
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,510
Unni..unni!

120
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,680
Sunbae-nim!

121
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,610
Yes.

122
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,970
I'm wondering if you know about this...

123
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:34,370
Are you keeping Im Won Jin's vehicle's black box file separately?

124
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:35,720
Why are you asking about that all of a sudden?

125
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,970
I think I can use it as the evidential proof

126
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,220
for Assemblyman Shin and Chairman Jo's case.

127
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,670
The security team is safekeeping it, per Chairman's order.

128
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,110
Contact me if you need anything more.

129
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,440
Yes.

130
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,740
This is really nice.

131
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,980
What is it, so early in the morning?

132
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,070
Why are you acting like this?

133
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,380
This early in the morning, what could it be?

134
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,170
I do not have time to talk.

135
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,690
My gift,

136
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,400
did you like it?

137
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,640
You said before that since we are different since birth

138
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:31,410
that we could not become friends, right?

139
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:35,040
I think you're right, come to think of it.

140
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,660
Just because you can visit my house sporadically, don't be confused.

141
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,270
K-Group

142
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,540
is mine in the end.

143
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,770
Don't be looking for Se Yeon either.

144
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:53,120
Guys who can't take care of their own women

145
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,550
always covet other guys' women.

146
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,810
Do a good job today.

147
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,550
At least for my company.

148
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,760
Good morning!

149
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,620
I'm sorry.

150
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,390
Because of some business with the art center I am a bit late.

151
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,520
Let's get going.

152
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,520
Yes.

153
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:48,210
You left like that before. How could you not contact me after that?

154
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,830
You,

155
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,780
why didn't you do it?

156
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:00,500
Please give this to the President.

157
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,280
Please take good care of it.

158
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,470

159
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:17,960

160
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,460
Excuse me, President! Some woman left this for you.

161
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:37,420
<i>This is combined earnings from prison labor income,</i>

162
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,990
<i>and condolence money from my father's funeral.</i>

163
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:44,430
<i>I will work harder and save more,</i>

164
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,140
<i>I'll repay you as quickly as possible.</i>

165
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,460
Where did she go?

166
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,640
She went that way.

167
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,670
Substitute driver!

168
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,260
Substitute driver!

169
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,860
Substitute driver!

170
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,560
<i>Yes?</i>

171
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,410
Substitute, you're pretty ballsy.

172
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:52,440
You're in debt to me and yet you avoid my calls?

173
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,050
I picked up, didn't I?

174
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,710
Well that's that.

175
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,270
But this,

176
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,920
what are you going to do by sending this piddly pin money?

177
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,860
Then I'll give it to you monthly.

178
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,990
<i>Never mind that.</i>

179
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:05,140
I will decide again what the contract content should be.

180
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,610
I never said I'll accept what you've decided.

181
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,480
Come to the hotel tomorrow.

182
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,670
Why don't you answer?

183
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:17,500
Tomorrow is an important day. I won't have time to come.

184
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,320
You dare to disobey my order?

185
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,620
I am sorry.

186
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,400
I can't cancel tomorrow's schedule no matter what.

187
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,130
I will hang up now.

188
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,950
Tomorrow's schedule...

189
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,920
Aye she hung up the phone.

190
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,570
Gwang Soo.

191
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,090
Gwang Soo!

192
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:37,220
Yes?

193
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,720
What's Kang Yoo Jeong's schedule for tomorrow?

194
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,640
Did she get a new part time job?

195
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,350
100% domestic, uh,

196
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,830
fresh,

197
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:56,060
fish just came in.

198
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,740
President! (calling man of certain age in a flattering way) Unni!

199
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,580
Come in and see.

200
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:02,400
Gunner, Mackerel and Gar, we have it all.

201
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,760
It's fresh right now.

202
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,730
You should take it when it's good.

203
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,580
What is she doing?

204
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,790
Since when has she been doing this?

205
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,980
I believe she's come to visit several times after she got out of the prison.

206
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,160
It's not really good.

207
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,680
No it's not. It's pretty fat.

208
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,530
So why am I only finding out about this now??

209
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:22,790
You told me to stop watching Kang Yoo Jeong.

210
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,470
Since when did you start listening to me?

211
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,870
Aunty!

212
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,440
These are nice and fat and delicious!

213
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,870
They're 100% fresh from the sea!

214
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,920
Unni, pretty Unni! These-these..

215
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,020
No?

216
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,580
Please come next time.

217
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,660
Goodbye.

218
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,870
Sir, would you like to buy some fish?

219
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:56,660
I'm busy.

220
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,720
Uhh... I'm okay.

221
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:01,870

222
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:07,640
I said I don't want to see your face. Why do find your way here and hurt me?

223
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,510
Let me take care of it.

224
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,820
Ahh, just get lost will you!

225
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,860
I will do it.

226
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,850
Take it and eat it.

227
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,910
Omo-nii, I will eat well!

228
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,070
Thank you. I will come back later!

229
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:42,730
Why are you here?

230
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,090
You wench. You don't even go home and hang around
here every chance you get.

231
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:59,400
What good is it to work bone-crushingly?
A huge chunk is going towards paying for monthly rent.

232
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,160
How can I save any money?

233
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,890
Is it worth living here?

234
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,550
This- who are you speaking informally to?!

235
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:07,550
Give you a little latitude and you start to talking informally?!

236
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,090
It's the president, Unni. Our President.

237
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:26,980
Ayy, get off. He's president to you, but hat doesn't make him president to me.

238
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,000
What are you looking at?

239
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,980
Ommo, why are you doing?

240
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:35,200
Oh, excuse us. She's actually a quite nice and pure girl
at heart, like soft tofu.

241
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,200
I am glad to meet you.

242
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,950
I am Sandara Park.

243
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:42,580
Oh my. Your eyes are so clear. Are you married?

244
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,040
Hey! Hey! Hey!

245
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,260
You're going to get hurt again.

246
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,740
Someone you know?

247
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,190
Oh, yes. Here,

248
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:58,080
let's have dinner together! Let's eat together.

249
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,720
Unni, I told you he's THE President.

250
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,120
Our President doesn't eat things like that.

251
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,140
How great of a trap is that, that it can't taste delicious food like this?

252
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:12,050
How could you, Grace Lee?

253
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:14,030
Oh, I am sorry.

254
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:17,540
Um, don't decline and come and share the meal with us.

255
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:20,660
Please have a seat.

256
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:24,500
This child's heart is like soft tofu soup but

257
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,960
she's practicing informal speech.

258
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,220
Please start.

259
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,530
Oh my, where is this fish from? It looks delicious!

260
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,110
And put it in the soup like this, and

261
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:37,440
I will apologise for that. Please accept this.

262
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,810
Please open your mouth.

263
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,210
Yes, yes.

264
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,710
Have a seat.

265
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:58,540
Let's eat. We have to eat to live anyway.

266
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,550
I guess you didn't know Yoo Jeong Unni can't stomach
going near fishy smell.

267
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:05,100
She only likes sweets and is a subtly picky eater.

268
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,150
Would you like to have a cup?

269
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,750
Me, too!

270
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,380
Right, here.

271
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,790
Let's have a toast-

272
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:13,890
Cheers!

273
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:16,700
Come in if you have something to say.

274
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,410
What is it this time?

275
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:39,010
How could you sell the fishes if you hate the smell so much?

276
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:42,310
You are quite shameless.

277
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:45,890
How could you think to go there?

278
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,640
The fact that I had a child,

279
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:59,050
you know that, right?

280
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:09,620
When I was in jail I had my child taken from me.

281
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:18,360
My child, while he was dying, I couldn't even see him.

282
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:25,990
They said he was in a lot of pain. I couldn't even hug him.

283
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:32,480
Losing my child after a only few years with him hurt this much,

284
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:40,670
how hard it must have been for So Ji Hee's mother.

285
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:44,200
I am forever indebted to her.

286
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:51,810
The fact that time cannot turn back what I did wrong, I know.

287
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,210
But still-

288
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:59,680
still as much as I want to avoid it,

289
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,640
I can't run away.

290
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,050
President!

291
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:39,480
This is too much to accomplish with my meager earnings.

292
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,790
Then you shouldn't have owed any money in the first place.

293
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:46,530
You said you aren't going to run away.

294
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:50,540
So why act nice?

295
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,640
Are you going to cry again?

296
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,770
Don't cry.

297
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:01,480
I don't want to see your thankful tears.

298
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,800
Hey, man.

299
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,940
Gwang Soo.

300
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:25,810
Seeing substitute driver hurting, why do I hurt more?!

301
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,750

302
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:41,490
I am Lawyer Ahn.

303
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,850
Yes.

304
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:18,890
Why isn't this working?

305
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:19,610
No?

306
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:21,850
Yes, it's strange.

307
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:22,720
Wait here for a bit.

308
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,590
Yes.

309
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,510
Sir.

310
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,300
Yes.

311
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,700
Would you like some coffee?

312
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:54,530
Yes, thank you.

313
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,470
What are you doing

314
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,540
this late at night?

315
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:50,200
I don't have any reason to report my off-duty
 activities to you, President.

316
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,320
I know that expression.

317
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,060
"I will not work at the company."

318
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:04,080
and "I've been caught." It's that kind of expression, right?

319
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,190
Is it because it's already been over 4 years?

320
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:11,750
I shouldn't know, but I think I know too much.

321
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:15,600
You'll be quite surprised to know how much I know.

322
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,040
Then what should we do?

323
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,690
I don't know anything about you, President.

324
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,810
Ah, not including one thing-

325
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:30,210
That without your father, you are nothing.

326
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:32,800
I know that one thing.

327
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:39,390
I crossed a patch of thin ice.

328
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:41,470
What would happen if the ice cracked?

329
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:45,680
What would happen to my parents who are watching me fall through the ice?

330
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,630
I shake uncontrollably and wonder if I could ever go back.

331
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:52,880
I came this far after crawling here one step at a time.

332
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,620
But how did the President,

333
00:27:54,620 --> 00:28:00,130
no, Jo Min Hyeok come this far?

334
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:05,380
Marriage?

335
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:10,870
Is that why you're using Se Yeon like that?

336
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:13,280
You said Se Yeon was your friend?

337
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:18,870
Then please don't do that...to a friend.

338
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:39,190
Yes, I'll check it for you right away.

339
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:41,430
Your phone continues to be busy, so...

340
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:45,350
I will call you again. Yes.

341
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,910
What brings you here?

342
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:53,070
I need confirmation regarding art item dealings between
Shin La Gallery and K Group.

343
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:55,730
Ah, yes.

344
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:02,430
Is this painting worth that?

345
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:05,840
Worth isn't absolute.

346
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:12,860
The moment Chairman decides to purchase,
the painting becomes worthy.

347
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,370
I guess people are like that too.

348
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:20,020
Depending on the perspective of the observer,
one can be an amazing

349
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:24,200
or a useless person.

350
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:38,920
I know that you're not doing this because you want to.

351
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:42,020
These are all detailed statements of superiors' dealings.

352
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:45,860
Those dealings are what I've accomplished in the end.

353
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,800
It doesn't matter.

354
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:53,690
Even if a problem arises, I won't let it hurt you.

355
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,940
<i>Read this. </i>

356
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:32,300
<i>A revenge that began because of a person, </i>

357
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:35,120
<i>how does it end? </i>

358
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,660
Kwang Soo.

359
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:42,780
Do you still believe that there is love?

360
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,990
Yes.

361
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:46,310
Why?

362
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:49,540
Rather than there being none,

363
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:52,190
isn't it better if there is?

364
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:09,500
I saw the file nicely.

365
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:14,210
Tomorrow morning I have to see the police, so

366
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:16,470
I'll leave first.

367
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:34,130
<i>I don't know anything about the President. </i>

368
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:36,880
<i>Except one thing. </i>

369
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,260
<i>That you're nothing without your father. </i>

370
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:44,450
<i> So that's why you're using Se Yeon like that.</i>

371
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:46,850
<i>I heard you're Se Yeon's friend. </i>

372
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:49,560
Ahh. I'm annoyed.

373
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,440
The hotel (share quality) rating starts from today on.

374
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,500
Before the panel of assessors arrive this afternoon...

375
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:08,490
Why are you looking at me like that?

376
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:12,510
Our marriage, you said it was a business marriage.

377
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:15,220
Do you really think like that?

378
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,490
Yes, it's a business.

379
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:22,560
We even wrote a contract.

380
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,850
It looks good.

381
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:45,110
Even in the morning, you working for my company. It looks very good.

382
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:49,400
But, where are you going so hurriedly?

383
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,750
You should report to me since this is during the hours of "duty".

384
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,950
In order for the Chairman to not be in a wheelchair,

385
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,680
I am working. Very busily.

386
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:01,900
From when did you take care of my father's health?

387
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,970
The Chairman has to be healthy

388
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,670
so that the President will have a light heart.

389
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:07,170
Stop it.

390
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,580
Min Hyeok. Why are you being like this?

391
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,600
In front of me,

392
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:17,520
don't take someone else's side, Se Yeon.

393
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:22,630
Then.

394
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,050
That bastard,

395
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:33,010
you said is your friend?

396
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:35,350
He's also my friend.

397
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:37,100
You're going to find out soon.

398
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,450
Lawyer Ahn,

399
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,960
whether he's a good friend or

400
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,500
a bad friend.

401
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:55,780
Se Yeon, look at this.

402
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:59,410
There wasn't one before, but

403
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:04,700
it bloomed. I wondered where the scent came from.

404
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,950
Isn't it very pretty?

405
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:10,940
They call this a gisaeng (courtesan) orchid.

406
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:16,540
I thought it was called a giseng flower because it was pretty.

407
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:20,050
Look, it has no leaves.

408
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,600
Only a flower hanging.

409
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,500
They called it a gisaeng (also can be parasite) 
because it can only survive by sticking to something.

410
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:32,800
It's just like me isn't it?

411
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:41,130
Se Yeon,

412
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:49,000
show Min Hyeok your soft side too.

413
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,130
You're too pretty and smart.

414
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:55,610
Guys, when a woman is better than men,

415
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:57,440
don't like it.

416
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,500
I don't care.

417
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,630
Whether he likes me or not,

418
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:05,000
he's still going to marry me.

419
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,660
Oh, it's coming.

420
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:18,900
Please eat well.

421
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,670
Yes.

422
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,160
Oh!

423
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,010
Honey! Look!

424
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:27,600
It's Do Hoon! Oh my!

425
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,450
Oh, he looks so handsome.

426
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:31,180
Omo omo omo...

427
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,860
look how handsome he looks.

428
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,820

429
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,390
Hello! Please come in.

430
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:41,710
Have you ever seen any rich asses getting arrested for anything?

431
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:44,500
So called intellectual and wealthy are all the same punks.

432
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:48,130
I guess he uses the good brain for lying.

433
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:50,050
What does it matter that they studied a lot?

434
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:51,670
Just drink.

435
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:54,250
Owner! One more ramyeon noodles over here, please.

436
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,870
Okay.

437
00:36:56,870 --> 00:37:01,390
<i>There's a rumor that K Group has made political contributions
through Shin La Gallery, is that true?</i>

438
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:03,310
<i>That's a rumor without facts.</i>

439
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:06,910
<i>Shin Hwa Gallery is a nonprofit organization</i>

440
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:08,410
<i>that works towards raising tomorrow's new artistic talent
of the nation of Korea,</i>

441
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:11,350
<i>and has no involvement with political funding.</i>

442
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:14,040
<i>In order to shed this kind of doubt, we in K Group,</i>

443
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,550
<i>will provide full cooperation to the Prosecution's investigation.</i>

444
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:19,450
<i>If there were to be any suspicion,</i>

445
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:23,620
<i>I will come here accompanying the Chairman myself.</i>

446
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,040
Thank you.

447
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:30,030

448
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:34,500
Hello?

449
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:41,370
What is this that Hye Ri invited us here.

450
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:44,190
I might have to live in your house so

451
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,830
I have to buy food at least once.

452
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,100
I'll eat well, Hye Ri.

453
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:51,810
This is too stiff, I want something soft.

454
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,430
Please eat this.

455
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:56,550
I'll get you some more, customer.

456
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:59,160
Okay. I need some soup! Bring the soup!

457
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,610
You know to bring our hae jang? (hangover cure soup)

458
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:03,600
Hye Ri.

459
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,040
I saw that there was a sign up front looking for workers.

460
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:11,540
Oh yes, there is a vacant spot.

461
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:15,430
That's great, Wait. No, come with me.

462
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:19,360
Boss,

463
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,970
have you recruited someone yet?

464
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:23,040
Why?

465
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,900
This unni is a god at part-time jobs.

466
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:29,030
She has done every service job.

467
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:32,260
She's the multitasking queen!

468
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,700
Really, your name is...

469
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,540
Kang Yoo Jeong.

470
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,430
Do you have experience?

471
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:42,240
Yes. From when I was in high school, I worked at fast-food restaurants,

472
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:46,990
hotel buffet, korean restaurants, coffee shops, restaurants.

473
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,360
Okay.

474
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:53,660
Then, I'll trust Hye Ri and hire you for a week first.

475
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:59,490
Yes. Thank you. I'll work hard.

476
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:15,220
<i>Deposit made by Substitute: $160, $144.70, $184.30.</i>

477
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:23,620
<i>Unnie, your mother would be happy if you bought these for her. 
These are really fresh.</i>

478
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,630
<i> Come again next time!</i>

479
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:29,640
<i>Mother, these mackerels! These mackerels are fresh, fat and delicious!</i>

480
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:33,390
<i>You thought you would be forgiven if you do that?</i>

481
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:52,490
What about that?

482
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,860
Are you sure that the assailant

483
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:12,360
simply turned back and left despite having seen
 Ji0 Hee collapsed?

484
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,300
That's what the evidence showed.

485
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,710
You can see that there were footprints of someone around
 (the accident site) who came and then went away.

486
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:20,440
Are you sure that it's her footsteps?

487
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:24,410
Though we can't confirm the size and shape for sure,

488
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:29,190
the fact that (assailant) recognized the victim's situation
gives proof and lays guilt to the assailant.

489
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:41,200
So, it is possible that it's not this girl's footsteps.

490
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,990
Hey, why do you keep bringing up the already concluded case?

491
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:47,620
Even Attorney Ahn came to check that file not too long ago.

492
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,510
Who?

493
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:49,490
Prosecutor Ahn.

494
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:50,860
Ahn Do Hoon?

495
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:55,040
Why? Is there something?

496
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:05,450
Even though they'll continue with the investigation,
even the Prosecution won't be able to attack openly.

497
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:10,720
However, it'll behoove us to be more careful of incidents
 that may cause rumors to fly.

498
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,310
Rumors?

499
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:15,070
The thing that represents the most danger to K Group

500
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:17,770
isn't the Prosecution, but President Jo Min Hyeok.

501
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:20,580
Attorney Ahn Do Hoon!

502
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:25,440
Speak on.

503
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,160
The opinions of board of directors about President 
Jo Min Hyeok is less than friendly.

504
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,310
The deteriorating hotel operation has already surfaced,

505
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:36,140
and there is a limit to what Shin Se Yeon can block.

506
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:39,300
They (directors) know best about your deteriorating health, Chairman.

507
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,910
Attorney Ahn! What is this nonsense?

508
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:47,070
You know better than anyone as to how many times

509
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:50,080
the Chairman traveled to Germany, Sunbae.

510
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,110
At first, I investigated it thinking that (the trips) were
related to investments overseas.

511
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:55,500
But they weren't.

512
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:01,800
Chairman. What is your ailment and how serious is it?

513
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,710
President Jo Min Hyeok has a long way to go before

514
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:10,050
he can solidify his position as K Group successor.

515
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,910
Min Hyeok is in his room, correct?

516
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:19,290
I believe his schedule today starts in the afternoon.

517
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:21,630
Take Attorney Ahn to him.

518
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:26,100
Why don't you talk some sense into him.

519
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:31,680
Your pride's got to be wounded to become strong.

520
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:39,660
Since he's due to come in soon, wait a bit.

521
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,400
Yes.

522
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:44,930
Don't spew whatever comes to your mind,

523
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:49,750
but always watch your mouth.

524
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:14,860
<i>Maybe it's because it's already been four years.</i>

525
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:18,880
<i>I think there's a lot I know about you, Attorney Ahn.</i>

526
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:24,110
<i>If you find out, just how much I know, you're going
to be really surprised, Attorney Ahn.</i>

527
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:35,310
I wonder what he's doing in a room without an owner?

528
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:48,060
What happened to the difference (proceeds) after
selling off the Icheon Hotel's ballooned share price?

529
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:54,090
There's information that you've suppressed the labor union in Jaeik Hotel

530
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,650
despite the recommendation of the Regional Labor Union Committee.

531
00:43:56,650 --> 00:44:00,250
This can lead to suspension of business,

532
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:01,420
are you at least aware of it?

533
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:06,270
Isn't that why I hired you, to take care of matters like that?

534
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,320
This is the kind of incident that can determine several thousands' livelihood.

535
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:28,720
- You should look at it with bit more sincerity.
- Who the hell are you to lecture?

536
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:32,530
I think you're blind to this mistaken reality of yours.

537
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:36,010
The person who knows better than anyone 
(about people's livelihood), is me, the President.

538
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:39,850
All you have to do is to do what you're told, Attorney Ahn.

539
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:42,300
I understand.

540
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:47,480
As for Ms. Kang Yoo Jeong,

541
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:52,030
she's someone I loved at one point.

542
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:54,790
So don't treat her cavalierly.

543
00:44:57,610 --> 00:45:01,710
I'm not sure what plan you're devising with Yoo Jeong,

544
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:07,530
but there won't be a second time that I would become your fiddle.

545
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:14,530
The hit-and-run from 4 years ago,

546
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:20,170
I wonder what bothered you so much that 
you'd review the investigation record again?

547
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:38,290
Please get ready, the Chairman is waiting.

548
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:40,520
I got it.

549
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:06,260
Shouldn't I be the one to pour for you?

550
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:09,300
It's thanks to you our stock rating passed without problems.

551
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,500
It's fine if you know.

552
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:16,400
There's going to be a party, will you come?

553
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:20,680
I will think about it.

554
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:28,000
Se Yeon.

555
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:33,460
If I were to have killed someone

556
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:38,890
and had to go to prison, what would you do?

557
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:42,220
I would select the best lawyer.

558
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:44,000
I would block (your jail sentence) by meeting up with

559
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,120
the prosecutor, the judge, if not them then even
the supreme court justice.

560
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,440
And if I still had to go to jail?

561
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:54,920
You wouldn't go to jail, I told you I wouldn't let you.

562
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:11,400
<i>Substitute Driver deposited $164.30 (into your account).</i>

563
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,430
Ah man, this little...

564
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:31,830
<i>Recipient: K Group Board of Directors</i>

565
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,060
Do Hoon.

566
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:04,820
What are you doing here?

567
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:07,090
We're friends, right?

568
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:08,580
Yes.

569
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:13,290
Is it okay to ask a favor of a friend?

570
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:15,490
Can you make time next Wednesday for me?

571
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:20,110
It's because of the party Mr. Jo Min Hyeok is hosting, right?

572
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:22,090
Yes.

573
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:24,200
Okay.

574
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:27,570
Instead, tell me the reason.

575
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:30,690
Is it to get interest from Jo Min Hyeok again,

576
00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:35,550
or is it because you actually want to go with me?

577
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:41,010
- That's of course because of Min Hyeok...
- I'll go with you.

578
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:43,900
I heard your answer.

579
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:56,820
<i>You did a good job, Prosecutor Ahn.</i>

580
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:59,190
<i>I didn't know you were going to handle it this well.</i>

581
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:04,580
<i>Set aside your personal feelings and judge
the incident based on letter of the law only.</i>

582
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,540
<i>Please believe me. There was no person. </i>

583
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:08,370
<i> I didn't see anyone. </i>

584
00:49:08,370 --> 00:49:10,490
<i>That, on that rainy road,</i>

585
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:15,290
<i>A truck suddenly popped out and my car slipped. We, </i>

586
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:26,140
<i>No, I...</i>

587
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:29,290
<i>I only hit a barrel that was around the construction site. That's all.</i>

588
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:30,690
<i>There's no way that could have happened. </i>

589
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:33,230
<i>I didn't know. No</i>

590
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:36,090
<i>I didn't hit a person.</i>

591
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:40,030
<i>Though we can't know for sure the assailant's
size or shape,</i>

592
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:44,330
<i>they did discover the footprints that came and returned
near the body.</i>

593
00:49:44,330 --> 00:49:49,370
<i>So this may not be a woman's footprints, you're saying?</i>

594
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:50,650
<i>No.</i>

595
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:53,710
<i>I don't think that I've paid my debt.</i>

596
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:55,930
<i>Forever...</i>

597
00:49:55,930 --> 00:50:00,050
<i>I will never forget it forever. How could I forget it? </i>

598
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:09,200
<i>My embarrassment</i>

599
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,940
<i>is nothing compared to that dead woman. </i>

600
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,290
Kwang Soo.

601
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:23,370
Yes.

602
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:26,790
Find out about it.

603
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:30,120
Yes.

604
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:48,140
Is this how your going to pay me back this month?

605
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:55,250
I'm trying to pay you back, so I'm working.

606
00:50:56,310 --> 00:50:59,170
Don't bother me if you want to be paid.

607
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:01,850
What are you doing?

608
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,670
On the day of the accident,

609
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:08,620
you said that you left even after seeing the body.

610
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:14,040
Did you really see the body and leave?!

611
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:22,790
Yes. I did it.

612
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,540
What do want?

613
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,630
After bothering me for so many years,

614
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:32,340
isn't it enough now?

615
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:44,700
With this kind of work, how are you going to pay me back?

616
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:47,830
Even you don't want to see me anymore.

617
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:07,540
Put this on her.

618
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:12,000
I'll take you to the other side.

619
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,760
Uhhh,

620
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,560
I...

621
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:19,720
I told you that if you do as your told today that I would cut your debt.

622
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:21,330
Driver.

623
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:45,400
I'm sorry.

624
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,500
It's alright.

625
00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:56,580
The design is cheap.

626
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,800
Change her into this.

627
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:28,580
That's good.

628
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,940
Ahh.

629
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:48,650
I remember now. Was it four years ago?

630
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:51,340
Please tell me more precisely.

631
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:04,370
Woo!

632
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:20,540
Why are you like this, without Min Hyeok?

633
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:26,030
Introduce yourself. This is the lawyer for K-Group.

634
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:30,710
What is this?

635
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:34,050
Are you guys playing partner changing games?

636
00:54:34,090 --> 00:54:36,410
Who is that girl?

637
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:44,880
She is someone you should not pay attention to.

638
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,300
In order to pay her debt to Min Hyeok,

639
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:50,700
she will do anything for him, I heard.

640
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,610
Se Yeon.

641
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:47,210
What are you doing. To what extent are you going to go?

642
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:48,670
No.

643
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:51,230
I thought you weren't coming today.

644
00:55:51,230 --> 00:55:52,670
So,

645
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:55,420
did you bring her because you thought I wasn't coming?

646
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:57,540
No, it's not like that.

647
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:03,420
I never said I wasn't coming here.

648
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,580
When you asked me,

649
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:09,080
I said that I would think about it.

650
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:17,360
Why are you like this?

651
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:19,350
The toy that person plays with,

652
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:21,300
I said that I could do it.

653
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:22,860
I didn't know that you would be here.

654
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:24,730
If I hadn't been here...

655
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:27,660
Would you just follow along because he says? And what about your getup?

656
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:29,680
I couldn't do anything. President forced me to...

657
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,330
If he asked you to,

658
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:34,160
would you sell your body?

659
00:56:58,060 --> 00:56:59,370
I'm sorry.

660
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:01,730
Are you alright?

661
00:57:01,730 --> 00:57:04,320
Yes. Thank you.

662
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,290
How much?

663
00:57:07,310 --> 00:57:08,290
Yes?

664
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,790
I heard that since your in debt with Min Hyeok,
 you do anything you're asked to do.

665
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:15,540
That debt, I'll pay for it.

666
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:21,500
Then, the things that I ask for...

667
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:24,250
It's not like that.

668
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:26,120
Then,

669
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:31,830
you're alright.

670
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:37,080
You're charming.

671
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:40,820
Are your crazy?

672
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:43,120
Come here!

673
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:45,930
Stay still.

674
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:47,330
Hey!

675
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:52,570
Hey! Come here!

676
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:55,120
Hey! You!

677
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:06,120
What is this?

678
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:10,080
She's an inferior good.

679
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:30,960
Get up.

680
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,700
What is this, Min Hyeok?

681
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:36,250
That girl is cheap.

682
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:39,830
What is this?

683
00:58:39,830 --> 00:58:42,980
I heard that if you give her money, she'll do anything.

684
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:45,670
What are you to act like you're all that?

685
00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:48,660
Buy yourself some clothes.

686
00:58:53,590 --> 00:58:56,710
Hey, is there a scar here?

687
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:05,200
She does do everything she is asked to do.

688
00:59:08,810 --> 00:59:10,040
Me.

689
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:13,820
She can only do what I say.

690
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:16,780
What?

691
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,400
Hey!

692
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,750
What happened? Where's Kwang Soo?

693
00:59:28,090 --> 00:59:29,790
I don't know.

694
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:35,650
Yes?

695
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:39,910
What? What do you mean a meeting at this time?

696
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:42,460
What? A meeting?

697
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:53,590
What? Ahh!

698
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:26,480
Min Hyeok. I can pass one time but never twice.

699
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,250
Watch me.

700
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:33,440
You. I won't let you go.

701
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,290
Wait for me.

702
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:39,480
See you again, you inferior thing.

703
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:51,750
Yes.

704
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:54,200
They came together.

705
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:57,610
He remembered clearly because they had a proposing event.

706
01:00:57,610 --> 01:00:59,340
When was that?

707
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:01,510
It was that day.

708
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:09,080
Are your sure?

709
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:15,250
Yes. It was the day of Ji Hee's accident.

710
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:16,750
Poor operation.

711
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:19,900
Increased vacancy due to group reservation cancellation.

712
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:22,810
Irregularity of share sales regarding Icheon Hotel and etc.

713
01:01:22,810 --> 01:01:27,200
I recommend President Jo Min Hyeok's dismissal.

714
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,190
With the shares that I have,

715
01:01:53,190 --> 01:01:58,150
I think I have the qualifications to join this meeting.

716
01:01:58,150 --> 01:01:59,630
What?

717
01:01:59,670 --> 01:02:02,710
The shareholders arranged this meeting.

718
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:05,210
These people.

719
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:07,100
How many people are there to oppose it?

720
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:10,660
The people who'd veto the recommended article
are more than half based on your influence.

721
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:12,640
Get them all on the line.

722
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:38,000
The meeting about Min Hyeok,

723
01:02:38,650 --> 01:02:40,450
let's start it now.

724
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:47,590
Then, we will

725
01:02:48,170 --> 01:02:53,420
start to count the vote on the issue of President Jo Min Hyeok's dismissal.

726
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:57,540
Please raise your hand for "yay"s.

727
01:03:13,550 --> 01:03:17,290
Let's go.

728
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:31,850
What are you?

729
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,830
What the hell did you do?!
