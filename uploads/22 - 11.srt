<i> Yoo Jeong is waiting. </i>

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,490
<i> Did you remember that?</i>

6
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:30,460
<i> Why shouldn't I? You're the one who drove.</i>

7
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,100
<i> You're blaming it on Yoo Jeong. Do you think I wouldn't know that?</i>

8
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,600
Substitute.

00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,740
Kang Yoo Jeong.

10
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,940

What happened, Do Hoon?

24
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:36,640
I'll make you some tea.

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,350
Wait.

<i>Secret Episode 11</i>

28
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,480
I'm sorry.

29
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,400
You always...

30
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,810
come inside my building and cry.

31
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,130
I'm sorry.

32
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,100
What is it this time?

33
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,900
Towards you...

34
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,730
I am sorry.

35
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,310
To see loved ones pass...

36
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:14,600
I know it doesn't happen only to me...

37
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,560
Because my dad,

38
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,440
my San, I sent them away like that...

39
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,270
and I feel so shameless being alive by myself.

40
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,900
So how disgusting would I

41
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,270
be to you?

42
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,770
That's fine if you know.

43
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,400
That helped me, too.

44
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,020
I'm not brave enough to die along side Ji Hee

45
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,770
but I found you

46
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,850
and hated you to death

47
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,770
to withstand it all.

48
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,930
You should

49
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:18,190
withstand it while watching me.

50
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:52,400
What's making it so difficult for you, Do Hoon?

51
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,310
People.

52
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:02,730
I became a prosecutor through another's sacrifice.

53
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,150
I came up here without anything in my hand.

54
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,350
But...

55
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,520
people on top are always predetermined.

56
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,350
I gave up everything and came up here,

57
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,690
but those who sacrificed are in my way.

58
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,610
Those who are up here aren't any different.

59
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,950
You would think it's luxury,

60
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:32,470
but I give up a lot, too, trying to live up to my parents' expectations. If you know that...

61
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,320
I know.

62
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,350
We both gave up, but

63
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,440
we began with different things in our hands.

64
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,320
Since when was the world fair?

65
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,310
It isn't fair.

66
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:49,650
But if you end it just complaining about it, you're the one that is foolish.

67
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,770
Thank you

68
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,560
for your advice.

69
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,980
It's not advice.

70
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:01,600
I'm just encouraging you to not give up.

71
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:14,600
Hi.

72
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,170
It's time to go check restaurant #43.

73
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:21,480
I know.

74
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,950
Gwang Soo,

75
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:27,060
how do you think she is doing right now?

76
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,440
How...?

77
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,930
Is there something wrong?

78
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,730
No, it's fine.

79
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,940
Let's go.

80
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,030
You can't see me relax on my one day off...

81
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,150
Please, Hye Ri, just for today.

82
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:46,920
I will take your place next time whenever you want to take off.

83
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,820
Anyway, is there something wrong? What's wrong with your face?

84
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,200
You didn't even come home last night.

85
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,310
Forget it.

86
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:56,500
I'm going.

87
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,480
Thank you.

88
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,600
Turn the car around to Hapjoong-dong.

89
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,290
I'm worried about Kang Yoo Jeong

90
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,370
Did something happen?

91
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,440
She acts like nothing happened.

92
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,330
That's why it's weird.

93
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,130
I...

94
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,960
saw someone like that before...

95
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,810
Anyway, I'm worried, so turn the car around and go back.

96
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,160
Okay.

97
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,390
Manager. Yes, Boss.

98
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,700
Hello.

99
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,880
I don't see Kang Yoo Jeong.

100
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,380
She said she has some emergency, so she switched shifts with Hye Ri.

101
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,940
Where is Kang Yoo Jeong?

102
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,480
Ahh...that...I'm not very sure.

103
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,040
You don't know? Does that make sense?

104
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,300
I asked but she didn't reply.

105
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,820
She only asked me to switch shifts.

106
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,970
It's written here. This is our phone number.

107
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:48,790
When the patient is missing, they contact us

108
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,630
from where he was first missing.

109
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:54,600
My father had this bracelet, too.

110
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,530
But...

111
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:58,360
it was missing...

112
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,350
You can't take this off by yourself.

113
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,440
Look at this.

114
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,030
By any chance, can you check whether there was a call?

115
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:10,190
If there was, we would have contacted you already.

116
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,330
The guardian is Ahn Do Hoon, right?

117
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,790
You can go first.

118
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,400
What's up?

119
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,710
I don't have a reason to see you.

120
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:38,140
I have.

121
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,580
Let's go out.

122
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,640
I don't have time. I have to attend the meeting.

123
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,650
This is more important than the meeting.

124
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,190
Go out!

125
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:57,350
Director, are you ok?

126
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,430
I said I have something to say.

127
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,240
Take her out.

128
00:12:59,240 --> 00:12:59,860
Oppa.

129
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,300
Hurry!

130
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,340
Oppa! Oppa!

131
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,410
Oppa!

132
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:11,710
Oppa!

133
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,870
Oppa!

134
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,990
Oppa!

135
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,490
I said she's not here! Why don't you believe me?!

136
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:27,540
So where is she?

137
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,920
I wanted to ask you the same thing.

138
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,180
She went to work but why hasn't been back for 2 days?

139
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,270
What happened to Kang Yoo Jeong?

140
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:39,020
You know where she is.

141
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,070
Maybe she hid somewhere because something happened.

142
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:44,980
She has so many things going on already, 
can't you just leave her alone?

143
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,840
What do you think you're doing?

144
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,760
When I went to Pohang to find my dad...

145
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,080
his bracelet was missing.

146
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:02,350
The bracelet...

147
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:06,190
Didn't you say it's not something that can be taken off by yourself?

148
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,400
Why are you asking me this?

149
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,440
Because that day...

150
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,830
you saw my dad.

151
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:16,680
No?

152
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,460
Yes, I saw him.

153
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,860
He got in the car.

154
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,060
But he kept trying to get out.

155
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:28,790
I stopped the car on the shoulder to avoid an accident,

156
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,330
but he just ran out of the car.

157
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,580
Lies.

158
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:36,110
It was raining and there were a lot of people so I couldn't find him.

159
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:39,780
So, you want to blame me?

160
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,870
Lies.

161
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,580
So what if I'm lying?

162
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:46,560
Yes, so what if I threw out your dad? So what?!

163
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,430
The one who couldn't take care of your dad is you.

164
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:55,020
You're the one who didn't agree to send him to a nursing home!

165
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,410
It was for your greed and your satisfaction!

166
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:02,090
My dad...

167
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,190
He trusted you.

168
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:09,920
Yes. Yes, and I'm sick of that.

169
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,600
So? So what if I didn't go after him? So what?!

170
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,610
Stop the car.

171
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,160
Stop the car.

172
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,730
Stop it!

173
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,600
I said stop the car!

174
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,760
Are you crazy?

175
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,890
What if an accident happened?!

176
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,090
Why did you do it?

177
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:12,280
How could you do that to me?

178
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,640
To my dad?!

179
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,520
Because you were sick of it,

180
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,960
is that why you took San away, too?

181
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,200
Is that why you took him away...

182
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,370
and left him to die?

183
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:40,800
What are you talking about?

184
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,710
You really did go crazy.

185
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:57,130
Get out.

186
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:04,530
How can I not go crazy?

187
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:09,000
How could you act so normal, Oppa?

188
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:14,190
Kneel down!

189
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:16,310
To San...

190
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,470
To my dad, apologize to them!

191
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,850
Kneel down and beg!

192
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,890
If I kneel down...

193
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:27,560
If I apologize...

194
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,960
Will you disappear?

195
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:39,180
I don't want to live looking back anymore.

196
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:43,060
You're there at the end, in the back.

197
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,570
You're holding on to me, it's disgusting!

198
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,880
Disgusting?

199
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:50,680
Me?

200
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,580
I was arrogant when I said

201
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,570
I could make you happy.

202
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:59,190
You said you don't regret it?

203
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:01,950
I regret it!!!

204
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:04,160
That day!

205
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:07,510
The day when you said you would go in place of me.

206
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:10,150
If I had left you then,

207
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,300
I wouldn't be regretting it now.

208
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:22,000
Regrets...

209
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,860
you will start from this moment.

210
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:28,610
Till you rip your heart out with regret,

211
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:31,450
and I will make it happen.

212
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,690
Watch it carefully!

213
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,040
So that you never forget me,

214
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,520
my San,

215
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:44,800
my father who thought of you as his own son!

216
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,380
I'll make it so that you can never forget!

217
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,080
Disappear from you?

218
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,550
Don't even dream about it.

219
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:58,760
Wherever you go, I will be there.

220
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:01,880
You will see me until you're sick to death!

221
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,540
Don't think about running away.

222
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,670
Why did you come?

223
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:13,100
I would like to be... by your side, Boss.

224
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,120
Why?

225
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,020
Because I have something I should do.

226
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,160
There is something I must do.

227
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,540
Without even knowing the reason,

228
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,330
did you think I would help you?

229
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,610
As you want, President...

230
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:34,030
I will not live a happy life.

231
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,150
The most miserable life possible,

232
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,840
I'll live like that for you.

233
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,160
I am asking you.

234
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:49,660
Why should I help you?

235
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:53,190
Is it because of Ahn Do Hoon?

236
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,440
What is this?

237
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:07,370
What about the time when you protected him, 
as if you would die in his place,

238
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:09,260
suddenly why?

239
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:14,120
What I can do for those people I lost,

240
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,870
because this is the only way.

241
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,560
Even though I can't get back 
what was taken away from me,

242
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,730
I have something I must receive.

243
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:36,190
<i>Director Ahn Do Hoon</i>

244
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,740
I will make it so that...

245
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:50,930
Your heart is torn with regret.

246
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,380
<i>Watch carefully.</i>

247
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,400
<i>So that you can't erase me</i>

248
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,330
<i> my son San, and my dad who thought of you like a son.</i>

249
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:01,400
<i>I'll make it so you can never forget.</i>

250
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,430
<i>This time too</i>

251
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:06,000
<i>If you do that again, I won't let it slide.</i>

252
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,540
<i>Okay, Son-in law?</i>

253
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:14,360
<i>Wherever you go, I'll be there.</i>

254
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:17,910
<i>So you'll disgustingly see me!</i>

255
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,440
I will not regret.

256
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,770
I will not

257
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:28,910
look back anymore.

258
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,910
Yoo Jeong.

259
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:40,850
Ahn Do Hoon crumbling

260
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:42,960
is something I've wanted as well.

261
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:47,200
Why bother choosing a difficult way?

262
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:51,550
Wouldn't kicking him out of K Group solve the problem?

263
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,050
Were you

264
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:57,730
satisfied

265
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,950
because you took it all away from me, Deputy Head?

266
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,870
If you take things away so easily,

267
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:09,640
you won't comprehend how precious the things

268
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,910
you've taken away are.

269
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,130
Then,

270
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,420
what is the reason you need me?

271
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,780
Because you...

272
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:27,460
you make Do Hoon Oppa more tenacious.

273
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,430
That way I'll not weaken.

274
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:38,300
"Give me one more chance." "Think of our past."

275
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,830
So that I'll not be shaken by such words.

276
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:08,680
Ahn Do Hoon,

277
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:13,400
what did he do to you?

278
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,550
Gwang Soo...

279
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:20,730
Use whatever method necessary

280
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,630
to find out what Kang Yoo Jeong did and who she met with

281
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,600
for the past week.

282
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:28,610
Unni.

283
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,330
Is there anything to eat?

284
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:41,160
You come home for the first time in 2 days, and
all you can say is "Rice"?

285
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,180
Whatever happened, you should say something!

286
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,140
I'm hungry.

287
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,480
I think I need to eat a bit.

288
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,100
I need energy to work, don't I?

289
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:54,730
I made some yellow bean stew.

290
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,320
Follow me...

291
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,060
Until the end of the second half this year,

292
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:16,560
we plan on completing the projects for 
in-country and overseas hotels.

293
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:20,810
During the slow season, hotel bidding system, 
the first in Korea...

294
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:25,140
I get the data, too.

295
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,640
Then what did you call me
all the way over here for?

296
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,470
It seems you're curious.

297
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:36,020
Since I'm not good at twisting the words around,

298
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:39,390
What happened between you and Kang Yoo Jeong?

299
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:45,310
What did you do and how, 
for Kang Yoo Jeong to turn around like that?

300
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,020
If you have nothing work related to discuss, I'll be going.

301
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,310
Lawyer Ahn.

302
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:57,520
You too were there on the day of the accident.

303
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:01,540
For the two of you who shares a secret like the life itself,

304
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:05,660
why you both ended up being so against each other, 
I'm so curious, I'm about to go crazy.

305
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,210
Neither of you are telling.

306
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,780
Gwang Soo?

307
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,980
Yes.

308
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,940
Are you checking it out?

309
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:20,280
The blackbox video will be restored soon.

310
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,920
Okay.

311
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,930
I'll see you at the Board Meeting.

312
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:34,780
Oh,

313
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:38,200
At the Board Meeting, Se Yeon is also coming, right?

314
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:43,030
Does Se Yeon know about the relationship 
between you and Kang Yoo Jeong?

315
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:47,030
My warning that you shouldn't be seeing Se Yeon,

316
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,720
don't forget it.

317
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:31,850
At King's Restaurant, the person who is assisting me with revenue growth and for new leaps,

318
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:34,270
I would like to introduce to you my partner.

319
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,290
I'm Kang Yoo Jeong.

320
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:58,770
Since when, enough for you to be able to attend the meeting,

321
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:00,920
were you promoted?

322
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:10,300
The Boss isn't yet familiar with the restaurant's menu, 
so I came with him.

323
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:13,860
Please don't misunderstand.

324
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,120
You said that last time as well.

325
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,900
But what to do?

326
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:23,950
He keeps misunderstanding.

327
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:29,540
What is the real reason you keep sticking to Min Hyeok?

328
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,600
Please excuse me.

329
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:52,520
Miss Kang Yoo Jeong, what you said to me...

330
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:55,010
This is it?

331
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:59,660
To use Jo Min Hyeok to get a promotion in your status?

332
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:05,080
Mr Attorney, didn't you get up there like that, too?

333
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,510
It isn't different from the reason you 
have Ahn Do Hoon by your side.

334
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:18,650
I also need someone by my side.

335
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:21,960
You really are going crazy.

336
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,050
You even know what kind of woman she is.

337
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:32,940
And if you knew what kind of man Lawyer Ahn was,
it would be different.

338
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:38,150
Let's go, Substitute.

339
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,380
Come to work at my house tomorrow.

340
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,240
Again?

341
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,720
I told you not to talk back to me.

342
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:13,630
Yes.

343
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,800
Is this much enough?

344
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,640
In front of Ahn Do Hoon,

345
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:26,650
be more confident.

346
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,100
Yes.

347
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,830
Thank you.

348
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:44,680
What do those two think they are doing?

349
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,540
At least those two together...

350
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:53,000
succeeded in getting your attention Se Yeon.

351
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,990
It bothers me.

352
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,080
If you want, Se Yeon, I can

353
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,430
split those two apart.

354
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,230
What is this?

355
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,100
<i>K Group Chairman Jo rumored in critical condition.
His secret departure to Germany revealed...</i>

356
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:42,300
<i>K Group, K Construction's unreasonable building
leads to negative fund turnover ratio.</i>

357
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,500
How do I stop the articles?

358
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,800
What's this?

359
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:54,190
These people all blab that they know everything,
so how come this is the first time I'm hearing about it?!

360
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:56,900
When will Father return?

361
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:01,100
Using Director Im and my name, we've planned to get
 a $20M credit loan from K Capital.

362
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,750
First, we must stabilize the share price...

363
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,870
What about Father? What does he say?

364
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,500
Why did he go to Germany?

365
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:10,600
Why did he go?!

366
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,830
We can't let the Chairman know.

367
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:16,320
We made it so no one can contact him during the surgery period.

368
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,450
Surgery?

369
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,180
What I don't even know as a son, 
the rumer sites are letting me know!

370
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:26,400
While Chairman isn't here, the head of K Group is you!

371
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:30,500
The person who knows that didn't think to TELL ME ANYTHING?!

372
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,420
K Hotel...

373
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,450
Start purchasing K Hotel shares first.

374
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,320
It was father's first business.

375
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,970
How's Father's condition?

376
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,630
We'll get notified soon.

377
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,530
You must return to the Hotel immediately.

378
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,560
Prove that you lack nothing as the successor.

379
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,200
Is this why Father said

380
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:00,250
we must make the restaurant business successful?

381
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:05,880
Chairman and K Group won't collapse that easily.

382
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,200
Hyung.

383
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:17,590
No matter how trivial, report it all to me.

384
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,460
Kang Yoo Jeong is the one who...

385
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:39,330
killed the woman Min Hyeok loved.

386
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:42,750
Knowing that and staying by her side...

387
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:47,530
Despicable, those two.

388
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:52,710
I thought I knew Min Hyeok..

389
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:55,260
But these days, I don't know anymore.

390
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:58,070
The obsession over that woman...

391
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:01,850
That reminds me of dead Seo Ji Hee.

392
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,740
Didn't you come because you had something to say?

393
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,220
Yes.

394
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:14,470
I said before that...

395
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,130
...there was a woman I loved, right?

396
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:24,130
So the woman I wanted to be with...

397
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,100
was Kang Yoo Jeong.

398
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,600
Do Hoon...

399
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,920
I didn't want to hear anything from other people.

400
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:44,920
Did it not occur to you that you were pretending 
not to know that girl in front of Min Hyeok and I?!

401
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,800
Jo Min Hyeok already knew.

402
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:53,620
The three of you have, at this very moment,

403
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:56,660
made me into a fool.

404
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,260
It wasn't intended, but

405
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,740
having lied to you as a result...

406
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:04,370
made me distressed.

407
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,930
I'm sorry.

408
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,790
You are "sorry".

409
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,510
You say it so easily.

410
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:16,070
I didn't know it'd turn out like this.

411
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:18,270
With Yoo Jeong, it was already over.

412
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:22,820
I also can't [stand] the wicked things Jo Min Hyeok is doing to her...

413
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:25,480
You're just the same.

414
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,380
All men are the same.

415
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,600
I was a bit strange to hope that you were different.

416
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,130
Se Yeon.

417
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:40,230
Isn't it enough that I've gone along with it while it lasted?

418
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,200
Don't give your excuses.

419
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,970
Since you didn't want to hear anything from anyone anyway.

420
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,990
Let's drink this that I made.

421
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,720
Oh~ It's hot.

422
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:19,700
Do you remember what you said when we didn't have
any work to do,

423
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:23,400
and we were in the room all day?

424
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,600
What was that?

425
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:28,100
If you bear it, 1 minute becomes 1 hour,

426
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,770
1 hour become a month.

427
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:34,540
Even if you don't fret, the thing that passes is time.

428
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,300
That's how we talked about ourselves...

429
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:44,100
Hey, when they say how they were in their olden days,
it's all lies.

430
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,260
Those are all stories to pass time.

431
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,350
Even then I

432
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:51,420
thought about how I would live in the future.

433
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:56,150
I thought recalling what happened in the past

434
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:59,000
was a foolish thing.

435
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,340
Thinking about my father and San...

436
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,500
Hey, don't think strange thoughts.

437
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:08,320
Wasting life living as you hate others,

438
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,970
that is the most unworthy thing.

439
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,790
In this world,

440
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:20,180
there are too many people who don't get punished
even though they did wrong.

441
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,620
It's strange, isn't it?

442
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:26,640
It's unfair.

443
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:29,300
Unni!

444
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,200
Come and eat Ddeok Bokki. It's all done.
(Spicy boiled rice cake - typical, cheap Korean snack).

445
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:51,430
So what is the real nature of your relationship with our President, huh?

446
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,870
Well, it's just that, you got dumped by Do Hoon Oppa, and...

447
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:59,050
Since it's come to this, just grab onto him.

448
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:01,040
Hey! This bitch...

449
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,400
You are really too much of a "direct narration".

450
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,900
Yoo Jeong, didn't you say that President will get married soon, no?

451
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:12,860
The woman having an affair with a married man, 
is an illegitimate existence.

452
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,540
Illegitimate? 
For someone who knows the law so well,

453
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:19,300
why did you have an affair 
with the president of your business partner?

454
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,500
Hey! Nasty!

455
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,730
He could live without the stars or the moon, 
but he said he couldn't live without me!

456
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:27,840
We love each other so much, we do!

457
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:33,210
Alright that's that. But it's not for you. 
Getting involved with a matter that's not good can't end well, understand?

458
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:38,890
Aiyoo, why? It's not like matchmaking animals. 
Would a real marriage be done like that?

459
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:41,380
And, the boss doesn't seem interested in that woman anyway.

460
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,680
Oh, really?

461
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,970
Don't worry. There's nothing like that.

462
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:48,100
Hey, you really know how to deny things!

463
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,380
Then what's the reason that you're with the Boss?

464
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,820
It's because you have feelings, too.

465
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:55,080
Hey, hey! Your mouth is the only thing alive!

466
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:58,910
Hey, why does ddeokbokki taste like this? 
Is this ddeokbokki? Go make another one.

467
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:00,990
Hurry, make another one.

468
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:05,480
Just bring some sugar. 
- Sugar only?

469
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:14,930
There was a woman who came to see Kang Yoo Jeong.

470
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:25,020
Lee Hye Jin, she served with Kang Yoo Jeong 
at the same correctional facility.

471
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,010
And?

472
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:31,290
Kang Yoo Jeong's child, 
the person who reported his abuse is this woman.

473
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:34,530
Three days ago, Lee Ja Young who lives together,

474
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:38,640
went and got the CCTV footage, 
which was at a location nearby the bakery.

475
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,840
Bakery? When?

476
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:47,550
It was a CCTV for traffic control. They said they took 
the footage of the day when her dad went missing.

477
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:51,950
The child and the father...

478
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,760
Find this woman. Find her no matter what.

479
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,450
Also, the CCTV, find it and bring it to me.

480
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:05,940
Yes.

481
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:29,200
<i>I had a woman whom I loved.</i>

482
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:31,660
<i>That woman was Kang Yoo Jeong.</i>

483
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:38,510
<i>What's the real reason that you're stuck
 by Min Hyeok's side?</i>

484
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:41,770
<i>It isn't different from the reason you 
have Ahn Do Hoon by your side.</i>

485
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:44,880
<i>I also need someone by my side.</i>

486
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:35,730
Thinking of you as a woman who killed someone...

487
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:40,260
As I get to know you you're more incredible.

488
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:44,310
I heard you and Do Hoon used to date.

489
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:50,530
What are you planning between the two men?

490
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:53,480
I'm sorry for worrying you.

491
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:57,430
A person who's supposed to be sorry comes into the house?

492
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:59,640
I have something I must do.

493
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:04,800
The debt that I have to pay back to the Boss,

494
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,850
and the debt that I have to receive from Ahn Do Hoon.

495
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:12,270
So,

496
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:16,990
you're sorry but you'll still stick by him?

497
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:19,070
Yes.

498
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:21,800
Do that then.

499
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:26,100
Because taking out a slug is not even work.

500
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:41,900
So, you want to fold this business that is making money?

501
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:45,560
Segwang is showing interest in the King's Restaurant.

502
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:49,860
Out of all K-Group's affiliates,
 the one that can be liquidated for cash is

503
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:51,270
only this place.

504
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:56,260
This place... you want to hand it over to Segwang?

505
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:59,370
Who is it that you're supposed to be
 working for?

506
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:02,100
With only the growth rate we have shown,

507
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,630
the investment amount that the Chairman wants,

508
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:06,450
it won't be approved by the Board of Directors.

509
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:11,810
Since when did I need you guys' approval?

510
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:14,730
The number of K-Hotel shares you own

511
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:20,020
does not surpass the number of shares 
owned by the Board and Shin Se Yeon. All decisions

512
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:22,950
will be determined by the Board.

513
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:47,370
How is it?

514
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:51,870
I figured you wouldn't have the time 
to come and see the paintings, so I came to hang them up for you.

515
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:58,940
She was audacious.

516
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:02,770
She has something to pay back to Min Hyeok, and

517
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:08,180
from you Do Hoon, 
she has something to receive.

518
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:18,780
Perhaps...do you still have lingering feelings 
for that woman?

519
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:20,960
No, I don't.

520
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:26,330
Are you sincere about wanting to 
forget Kang Yoo Jeong?

521
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:30,570
Yes. I've forgotten.

522
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:32,900
Then that's fine.

523
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:38,770
Because the past has no strength anyway.

524
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:43,850
These two people, 
you said you could split them up, right?

525
00:46:58,430 --> 00:47:01,840
Please do it.

526
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,970
For telling me first about that woman,

527
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:18,880
for keeping your courtesy to me,

528
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:24,860
thank you.

529
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:39,330
It's suspicious...you coming in at 3 in the morning.

530
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:40,880
I had work to do.

531
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:46,860
That's why. What work did you have that 
you worked so hard?

532
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:53,340
Work to help feed and shelter us. 
At a restaurant.

533
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:56,420
You're going home with me tonight, right?

534
00:47:56,420 --> 00:48:00,540
I can't, I have a lot to do.

535
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:08,420
It's good that you're making progress with the boss, but

536
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:11,840
a woman loses her charm if she's too easy. 
You know, right?

537
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:14,860
Hye Ri? 
- Yes. You know? Right?

538
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:27,220
Since when the Board of Directors 
could not wait to sell a profitable subsidiary? To Segwang at that!

539
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:31,740
This meeting here, 
I understand you do not have the right to attend.

540
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:32,360
What?

541
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:38,800
Since you have been dismissed, 
you cannot attend internal meetings.

542
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:47,890
Close the door.

543
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:52,520
Let me go!

544
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:58,490
Please take him outside.

545
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:02,430
Let go!

546
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:05,880
Ahn Do Hoon!

547
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:12,860
I'm Jo Min Hyeok! This company's owner is me!

548
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,010
The result of the Board meeting, 
what happened?

549
00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:25,640
You always seem to look for me at times like this.

550
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:30,000
The shares you own, liquidate it and invest in me.

551
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,790
For what merit of yours?

552
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:36,440
You said we're not even friends now.

553
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,090
What is your value as a collateral?

554
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:42,260
This kind of crisis, we've had it more than once or twice, 
it's going to pass anyway.

555
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:44,120
If father returns and finds you like this,

556
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:46,620
I'll have something to say at that time.

557
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:50,890
Putting aside a woman you'll be marrying, and 
taking another woman around by your side in public,

558
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:55,530
that right there is enough for your disqualification.

559
00:49:55,530 --> 00:50:01,000
Unlike your mom, I'm not a person 
who can have an intimate relationship, don't you also know that all too well?

560
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,010
Shin Se Yeon!

561
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:03,900
Do not shout!

562
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:08,340
Neither you nor she are in your right minds.

563
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:12,220
I'm doing this to talk some sense into you before you
become crazy.

564
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:14,410
Be grateful.

565
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:21,840
Send off Kang Yoo Jeong to... wherever.

566
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:24,640
Then I'll consider doing your favor.

567
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:29,590
Weren't you, at this point in time, desperate?

568
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:46,890
Never again mention

569
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,680
my mom.

570
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:26,840
Hey, Jae Ha!

571
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,830
Where are you?

572
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:32,070
What do you mean why?

573
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:34,160
Because I want to give

574
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,920
that apology you so wanted.

575
00:51:43,870 --> 00:51:46,260
Uh, you're here.

576
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:52,990
I wonder what Attorney Ahn is doing here.

577
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:55,350
Because my work ended well,

578
00:51:55,350 --> 00:51:57,620
I came by to have a drink with a friend.

579
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:58,990
A friend?

580
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:03,320
Thanks to you I met a decent friend.

581
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,980
Thank you.

582
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:08,870
At first it was my father you tempted,

583
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:13,280
then Se Yeon and now even Jae Ha?

584
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,880
Amazing, Attorney Ahn.

585
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,240
Per your advice,

586
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,950
I put some effort into networking.

587
00:52:22,830 --> 00:52:25,700
You weren't here to apologize?

588
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:30,110
Hey, drink up, then

589
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:34,000
give it a try.

590
00:52:37,930 --> 00:52:42,710
Ah, since you're going to [apologize], why not have that
"damaged good" [KYJ] do it too?

591
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:44,580
Then you never know.

592
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:47,630
Maybe my company, Se Gang, could

593
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:50,520
help out your tiny restaurant?

594
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:51,670
Jae Ha!

595
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:56,580
That's why, you should have been nicer when I was your friend?

596
00:52:58,350 --> 00:53:01,500
We are both friendless.

597
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:10,500
If you have nothing to say, then take off.

598
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,850
So that we can chat amongst friends.

599
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:15,640
Even if the company [restaurant] gets acquired,

600
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:19,000
I'll make certain all the employees' retention will remain in tact.

601
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,960
Please send a message to Yoo Jeong that she needn't
worry about her employment.

602
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:28,250
Ah, I hope that Chairman gets better.

603
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:30,840
Ah, that mug.

604
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:35,190
He comes and goes [here] as if it's his master suite.

605
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:37,470
Where is Kang Yoo Jeong?

606
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:40,060
Is Kang Yoo Jeong your dog's name?

607
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:42,160
Do you think she's the kind that will come with tail swishing when called?

608
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,530
Where is she, I said?

609
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,430
Stop working her so hard.

610
00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:49,510
She works all night so often.

611
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:53,310
What's there to work all night over a crappy little restaurant.

612
00:54:55,650 --> 00:55:00,200
I'm going to report you as the vicious employer.

613
00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:54,490
Substitute?

614
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,590
Why are you still here?

615
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:08,070
President, the sauce this time, 
it tastes pretty good.

616
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:12,700
It goes good with meat, 
and have special tangy taste with salad, too.

617
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:14,160
I think the response will be great.

618
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,830
Do you think that will change anything?

619
00:56:16,830 --> 00:56:20,180
If the board of directors decide to sell this restaurant, 
we're both going to be fired.

620
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:22,120
We won't know until the end.

621
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:24,490
We don't know, yet.

622
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:39,330
Would you like to taste this? 
It seems alright to my taste.

623
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:54,710
Don't smile.

624
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:58,290
You would smile like that,

625
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,660
will you, too... also leave me?

626
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,630
Once you get what you wanted,

627
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:12,820
you'll also... be leaving me, right?

628
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:30,320
You said you wanted me to do what you tell me.

629
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:37,930
Until you tell me to leave, Boss...

630
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:42,180
I will not go.

631
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:04,160
<i>♫ A person came into my life</i>

632
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:10,730
<i>♫ The person I should not love</i>

633
00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:19,140
<i>♫ If the tears steal the heart and disappear</i>

634
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:24,910
<i>♫ Because I thought she would come closer</i>

635
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,600
<i>♫ I believe that I love you</i>

636
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:31,700
<i>♫ It's shaking me like crazy</i>

637
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:35,500
<i>♫ I believe that I love you</i>

638
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:39,400
<i>♫ If this limping love of mine</i>

639
00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:42,290
<i>♫ If it moves closer, because you</i>

640
00:58:42,290 --> 00:58:44,050
<i>You came?</i>

641
00:58:44,050 --> 00:58:46,540
<i>Even without you coming here, 
I was just going to watch something interesting...</i>

642
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:48,880
<i>I was with Yoo Jeong that day.</i>

643
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:49,530
<i>So?</i>

644
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:51,070
<i>Kang Yoo Jeong. 
You woman...</i>

645
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:53,350
<i>By any chance, did Attorney Ahn do it?</i>

646
00:58:53,350 --> 00:58:56,670
<i>Yoo Jeong, it seems like you have a date set for your death...</i>

647
00:58:56,670 --> 00:58:58,230
<i>I can't die, even if I wanted to.</i>

648
00:58:58,230 --> 00:59:01,500
<i>Making food in the kitchen, how can you get revenge?</i>

649
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,010
<i>Doing great!</i>

650
00:59:03,010 --> 00:59:04,530
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

651
00:59:04,530 --> 00:59:06,150
<i>Would you like to eat before you go?</i>

652
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:08,700
<i>There is no secret in the world, right?</i>

653
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:10,310
<i>Regarding Kang Yoo Jeong's father...</i>

654
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:12,630
<i>I'll think about that slowly.</i>
