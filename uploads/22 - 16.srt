<i>Secret</i>

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,980
Attorney Ahn! Attorney Ahn! 
About that news on the media...

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,540
About that great Attorney Ahn Do Hoon,

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:09,760
I have something to say!

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,740
Attorney Ahn, have you got something to say?

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,500
Stop it! I said stop!

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,910
Just stop it, really!

8
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:18,190
Why?

9
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,900
San...

10
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,950
San...

11
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:29,050
Aren't you going to see him?

12
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:36,070
San... Your son.

13
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,650
Don't you want to see him?

14
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,900
How dare you...

15
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:49,060
How dare you mention my San with your mouth?

16
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,620
My San is alive, and...

17
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:01,030
there is no way I wouldn't have known...

18
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:08,070
How could you use San as an excuse...

19
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,960
You...

20
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,420
It was for you and Do Hoon.

21
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,410
The child is growing fine. Trust my words.

22
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,810
You two should live first.

23
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,590
Yoo Jeong, with that red line on your record,

24
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:25,850
unmarried woman with a child on top of that, 
how are you going to live?

25
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,010
Do Hoon also with you,

26
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,230
would you guys even make sense?

27
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,870
How can you take responsibility for a child born in prison?

28
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,200
For a person to whom your own child is so precious,

29
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,680
how could you...

30
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,630
How could you do that?

31
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,710
So what if he was born in prison?

32
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,590
Can the mother have a record?

33
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,170
Is it not okay to raise him alone?

34
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,470
So what if his dad's a murderer!

35
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,470
Bring him out! Bring him out!

36
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:07,420
Bring him out! Where's my San?!

37
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,190
How can you?! Where is my San?

38
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,800
HOW CAN YOU?!!!

39
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:21,900
Why? Why? WHY??? Why?

40
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,290
Why? Why?

41
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:32,390
Why?!

42
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,980
Hello! 
- You know that time...

43
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,730
Oh, of course!

44
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:57,100
Yea, that's right.

45
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,120
Mom!

46
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:17,300
Mom!

47
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,830
Why that woman...

48
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,490
No! What are you doing to my son?

49
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,930
Jeong Hwan, are you okay?

50
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,970
That's San.

51
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,920
His name is San, you know.

52
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,980
Jeong Hwan, let's go.

53
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,610
He's my San!

54
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,080
Why?! Really!

55
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,880
Let go! LET GO!!!

56
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,250
Yoo Jeong!

57
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,830
Take a good look!

58
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:54,450
Look what you have taken away from me!

59
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,650
Didn't know...

60
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,980
I, really didn't know.

61
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,170
Don't you dare tell me you didn't know!

62
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,340
You could have found out.

63
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,740
When they said San was dead,

64
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,830
you just didn't see?

65
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,980
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO SEE IT!!!

66
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,980
While your mom was working on this,

67
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:21,540
did you just pretend not to know? 
Saying you didn't know?!

68
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,490
How could you?!

69
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,480
Unni...

70
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,970
San didn't recognize me.

71
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:55,030
How could he not recognize his mom?

72
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,570
How could he do that?

73
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:15,420
I have to find San.

74
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,380
I have to bring him back.

75
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,960
Of course, you do.

76
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,530
You stomach was hurt, you breast fed him, 
of course you have to take him!

77
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,040
These bad people, I'll just...!

78
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,170
Hey, Ja Yeong! Where are you going now?

79
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:30,120
You're going to go and do what? 
You want to crash everything?

80
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,040
That's just you taking out your own feelings.

81
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,450
It won't be helping Yoo Jeong at all!

82
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,890

83
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:44,570

84
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,690
Hye Ri, what are you doing just standing there? 
Go get a bowl of cold water.

85
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,330
Hey, Ja Yeong,

86
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,120
when we were in the can,

87
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,350
do you remember that darky granny in the cell next door?

88
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,870
That granny,

89
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,060
she is a documentation forgery expert.

90
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,080
There is no technician in the country that she doesn't know.

91
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,480
Let's first contact her. Contact her and

92
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:14,210
the bastard who made a fake death certificate, 
and a fake adoption paper,

93
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,320
let's go find that bastard.

94
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,540
Are you still a human being doing things like that?

95
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:26,450
How could one human do that to another?

96
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:29,530
No, this was all for Do Hoon-
- STOP!!

97
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:32,110
It's always just "Do Hoon, Do Hoon."

98
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:35,750
That's what ruined Do Hoon, woman!

99
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:39,300
Aigoo~ What am I to do?

100
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,550
I'm so sorry towards Yoo Jeong. What to do?

101
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,680
How did you do this?

102
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:56,070
Document wise, he was clearly a dead child!

103
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:00,990
Mom, do you know what wrong you have done?

104
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,690
Ah, well, you see...

105
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:07,130
Jung who comes to the sauna...

106
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,270
because her niece didn't have a child...

107
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,200
Mother!!

108
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:15,120
I did it for you.

109
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,990
Would I have done it for myself?

110
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:22,910
Would you think even for me 
that it was easy to cut my bloodline?

111
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,530
How would you have raise him?

112
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:29,000
Being loved in a good family, and might as well

113
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,070
<i>Excuse us!</i>

114
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,690
Yes, we'll excuse ourselves.

115
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:38,830
We came from a police office.

116
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,630
What is it?

117
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:47,530
Ah...yes...Mrs. Park Gye Ok?

118
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Mrs. Park Gye Ok, you know Mr. Lee Sang Cheol, right?

119
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,060
From you Park Gye Ok, Lee Sang Cheol

120
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,040
received $3,000, and

121
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,620
forged a death certificate, he said.

122
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,630
Is that correct?

123
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:13,820
Ah, the victim filed a complaint.

124
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,510
Anyway,

125
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,150
on charges of document forgery and

126
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:20,190
for the crime of utilizing a forged document,

127
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,800
we're going to take you in for questioning, yes?

128
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,550
Wait a moment.

129
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:27,410
Even if that was true, it's a first offence.

130
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:30,030
i know the rule, you needs to proceed without detention.

131
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,570
I am the grandmother.

132
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,330
I did it to benefit everyone involved,

133
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,110
do you think I've done it without any reason?

134
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:41,820
Well, of course. Everyone has their reasons, I'm sure.

135
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,550
Whatever. I'll be escorting you now.

136
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,480
Now.

137
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,640
Wait... Look here.

138
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,160
- Do Hoon!
- Wait, Detective!

139
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,710
Honey. Honey!

140
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,250
Detective!

141
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,370
Do Hoon! Do Hoon!

142
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:00,200
Are you going to let your mom get taken like that?

143
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,650
Don't you think you should do something!

144
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,020
What exactly?

145
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,390
What more can I do?

146
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:15,560
Honey! Honey!

147
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,830
Why? Do you have something to say?

148
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,690
What is it?

149
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,760
You have something to say, don't you?
Hurry up and say it.

150
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,920
Kang Yoo Jeong,

151
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,680
they say her child is alive.

152
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,030
What?

153
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,020
Park Gye Ok?

154
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,280
Someone came for you.

155
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:22,050
If you make San appear to be dead, 
it will get me to leave Do Hoon, and

156
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,770
if you bring San back alive from death,

157
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:27,520
I would be so thankful,

158
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,520
I will forgive Do Hoon,

159
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,580
did you expect it like that?

160
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,030
Back then, that was the best choice.

161
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,190
You also had a whole life ahead of you...

162
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,940
Just like my father,

163
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,160
try having a hard time.

164
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:49,620
Do Hoon rotting in prison,

165
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,080
please watch him.

166
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,430
Yoo Jeong!

167
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:56,650
Do Hoon did no wrong. Do Hoon didn't know. 
It was all my doing!

168
00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:00,500
For a person to whom your child is so precious to you,

169
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,420
you shouldn't have done that to me.

170
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:09,100
That family loves San so much.

171
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,050
I go and see him every month.

172
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:16,160
They always make me eat dinner with him, 
because I'm his grandma.

173
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,350
They're such good people.

174
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:21,440
What about me?

175
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,770
Were you afraid I wouldn't be able to raise him like that?

176
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,330
Face of the son who is alive,

177
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:36,790
the pain of not being able to see him when you want to,

178
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,660
please experience it.

179
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,580
Yoo Jeong!

180
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,500
I'm asking you.

181
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,640
Please don't take...

182
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,000
Jeong Hwan from me.

183
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,420
I...

184
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,840
have never abandoned San.

185
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,260
If I had known...

186
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,280
If I had known that his birth mother was alive,

187
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,640
I would have come to find you.

188
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,930
When Jeong Hwan grows bigger,

189
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:32,500
when he reaches an age at which he can understand,

190
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,860
that I gave birth to you with my heart,

191
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,220
I was going to tell him.

192
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,230
I wasn't trying to deceive him.

193
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,840
Since he's still...

194
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,750
at an age when he can't understand,

195
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,730
it's still not too late.

196
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:55,380
No...

197
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:59,370
How I raised him...

198
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:03,170
No...

199
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,880

200
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:12,990
My Jeong Hwan...no, no.

201
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:27,900
It can't let you have your way, either.

202
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:32,540
My San,

203
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,700
I also cannot give up on him.

204
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,130
No...

205
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,190
No...

206
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,090
Please stop drinking.

207
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,210
Please stop.

208
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:00,740
Are you going to say you want to die 
after drinking like before?

209
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,110
Yes.

210
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,940
If I had rather died back then,

211
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:10,070
my son breaking down like this,

212
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,820
I probably didn't see it.

213
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,120
Mom will be coming out soon.

214
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,750
Since it was her first offense, it will be over with a fine.

215
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,380
Like venom.

216
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,320
You or your mother,

217
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,590
how can humans be so venomous?

218
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:29,920
It's because you're so weak!

219
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:35,230
Alright.

220
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:37,220
It's all no-good,

221
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,200
my fault.

222
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,610
Yeah.

223
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,240
Ahjusshi!

224
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,550
This girl, really.

225
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,880
The Chairman is waiting!

226
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,960
No, he needs to see me first.

227
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,900
Min Joo! 
- We couldn't even give him a nice birthday since ahjussi was in jail.

228
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,020
Come here. I bought you some gifts.

229
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:09,320
Ta da!

230
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,310
These are the gifts?

231
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,650
I heard you liked this, Ahjussi.

232
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,600
Wasn't that so?

233
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:23,610
I like it.

234
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:27,180
That's a relief.

235
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:42,030
In the winter,

236
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,610
I took my younger brother and went to find my father.

237
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:48,210
Father didn't come out and I was hungry.

238
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:51,310
I <i>the fully grown kid</i> was crying, when

239
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,580
the Chairman came to us, and

240
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,980
this is what he bought for us.

241
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,700
It was really delicious.

242
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,920
What's all this food that are less than good?

243
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,350
Please wait. I'll have a meal prepared soon.

244
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:12,980
Ahjusshi said he wanted to eat this.

245
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,900
You should just take care of your daughter like that.

246
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,880
You're not even letting me eat because I might gain weight.

247
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,730
You can't. You have to lose 2kg more.

248
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:23,350
Do you want to look plump on your graduation album?

249
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,530
Min Joo, don't eat ramyun!

250
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:34,000
Ahjusshi, my mom seems totally like a stepmother, right?

251
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,450
Why is the reaction so serious like this?

252
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,980
Just go along with it. I have known everything.

253
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,380
I've known since middle school.

254
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,400
Even as you know, you do it on purpose?

255
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,920
Yes.

256
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,200
When I call her stepmother,

257
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,840
My mom looks like a female main character of a tragedy, 
a tiny bit.

258
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,140
At that time, she is very pretty.

259
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,620
After that, she always treats me nice.

260
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,400
I got mad at first for no reason, but

261
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:10,350
still, she is my mother. Right, Ahjussi?

262
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,020
There was a blanket

263
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,790
with stars and a moon.

264
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:48,890
One moment please.

265
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,600
Here.

266
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,260
When I first bought him home,

267
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:18,290
he couldn't sleep without this. Because it's a little old...

268
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,870
I can take it, right?

269
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:29,150
I'm home.

270
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,830
Oh, Jeong Hwan.

271
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,560
Jeong Hwan, why did you come home so early?

272
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,450
Why, does your tummy hurt again?

273
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:36,760
If your tummy keeps hurting, then mommy...

274
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,610
Mommy also hurts.

275
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:43,140
Mommy also hurts?

276
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:47,070
But who is that ahjumma?

277
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,190
Mommy,

278
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,360
why are you crying?

279
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:02,520
Are you hurt?

280
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,640
Why are you hurt?

281
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:10,680
Is it because of that Ahjumma?

282
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:14,900
No! It's because of me.

283
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,500
That person hasn't done anything wrong.

284
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,950
That doesn't seem right.

285
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,260
Should I straighten out that Ahjumma?

286
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:42,180
Next week,

287
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,440
there is a trial.

288
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,980
I'll see you there.

289
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,920
It's what I made for San, but

290
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:38,730
she said he can sleep without this now.

291
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:43,780
He has an allergic reaction when he eats blue crabs.

292
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,200
When he is upset,

293
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,370
she said he has a habit of tearing up the paper.

294
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:55,660
During the weekend, 
she said he goes bicycle riding with dad.

295
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,810
Have you known?

296
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,560
Yoo Jeong.

297
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,570
I'm totally confused.

298
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:05,900
It's my child, but

299
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,610
it's clearly my San, but

300
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,960
what he likes, or

301
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:15,170
how he grew up,

302
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:18,070
I have no clue.

303
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:22,770
What would you want me to do?

304
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,840
Do you still not know?

305
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,420
Are you not coming home again today?

306
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,270
I have to work on the paintings 
that will be going to Hannam-dong.

307
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:00,600
She is quite a capricious person, 
as you would also know.

308
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:03,460
The gallery business,

309
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,830
you should stop doing that.

310
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,520
Buying and selling the paintings does not suit you.

311
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:15,800
That is my work. What would I do, if it doesn't suit me?

312
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,740
You...

313
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:25,420
look the most comfortable when you're painting.

314
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,910
I'm busy.

315
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,210
Would you go?

316
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,270
Se Yeon,

317
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,740
when I was having a hard time,

318
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:00,820
did you feel like this then, too?

319
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:05,180
I want to do something somehow, but

320
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:09,340
because it's hard to figure out what I should do.

321
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,370
I would like to see you stop having a hard time 
because of me.

322
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,210
Still...

323
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,770
you and I...

324
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,780
we had fun.

325
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,140
Without even knowing that we were the outcasts 
to the other kids,

326
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:32,010
we were hanging out together, and

327
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:36,090
we had great time by ourselves. 
- Stop!

328
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,870
In order not to like you,

329
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:49,130
because I'm trying, so I said stop it.

330
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,710
I'm sorry.

331
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,870
I'm sorry.

332
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:40,850
Try this.

333
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,560
Your mom's seaweed roll, it's good?

334
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,640
This? This? Ah.

335
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,660
Mom makes great Seaweed roll, right? 
- It tasted good.

336
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,290
It's the best, right?

337
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,550
Jeong Hwan?

338
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:12,620
Jeong Hwan.

339
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,430
Ahjumma, you came again?

340
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:29,210
I'm not Ahjumma.

341
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,120
I'm aunt.

342
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:45,230
Aunt who is good friends with mom.

343
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,130
Go and play.

344
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,980
See you again?

345
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,470
Jeong Hwan.

346
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,510
Go.

347
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,930
Dad, I want to ride the bicycle!

348
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:17,350
Yeah, let's ride the bicycle.

349
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:26,880
Going~

350
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,500
Woo hoo hoo~

351
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,160
Thank you, Ahjussi.

352
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:49,290
Oh, ah. Are you alright?

353
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:53,040
Thank you. Let's go.

354
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,890
Oppa,

355
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:05,050
what you took away from me, look.

356
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:08,770
In your life,

357
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,070
what you have missed, look at him.

358
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:16,490
Woo Whoa...

359
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,890
Abandoning that precious thing...

360
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,710
what has happened to us,

361
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,130
just look.

362
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:08,240
I'm sorry, Yoo Jeong.

363
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:15,180
I did wrong.

364
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,540
Yoo Jeo...

365
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,160
..am sorry.

366
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:26,700
Yoo Jeong...

367
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:35,950
I said I did wrong...

368
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,970
Fool, fool, fool!

369
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:58,510
How are you going to live with your child away from you?

370
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:04,190
Unni, I'm not making him be apart from me.

371
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,610
Just because of being a mom,

372
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:11,370
doesn't mean you must live holding the child in your arms.

373
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,050
My San being happy

374
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:17,450
is enough for me.

375
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:25,140
You don't know how happy my San smiles.

376
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,030
Ou, ou I'm so frustrated.

377
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:29,290
Ou, I don't know.

378
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:31,320
If my child was taken away like that,

379
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:35,130
I would go to the end of the earth to find him.

380
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:38,100
I also

381
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,770
thought I would be like that.

382
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,460
I couldn't do it.

383
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,750
Because when I had San taken away from me,

384
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:55,260
I was so hurt, and

385
00:30:56,610 --> 00:31:00,380
had experienced feeling like dying,

386
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:06,540
I couldn't take him back.

387
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:11,140
When that family

388
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:15,280
first took my San,

389
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:23,630
they said he cried so hard.

390
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,820
Looking for mom,

391
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:32,320
for a whole week, without even eating anything,

392
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:38,030
they said he cried like that.

393
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,420
And so how can I take San back?

394
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,560
Missing that mom,

395
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:54,210
San who will cry all day...

396
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:58,410
How can I take him?

397
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:48,840
<i>Premarital Agreement</i>

398
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:55,110
You seemed to have overvalued me.

399
00:32:56,650 --> 00:33:01,020
Even if you didn't see me, I thought I could hold out, but

400
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:05,010
I can't.

401
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:08,760
Let's call it quits now.

402
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,350
Se Yeon.

403
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,400
Jo Min Hyeok.

404
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,610
Don't worry.

405
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:31,910
I'm Shin Se Yeon.

406
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:51,030
You're handing over your shares to Se Yeon?

407
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:54,320
To the girl who could turn around anytime,

408
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,690
you hand over your shares?

409
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:57,270
It's not Se Yeon, but

410
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:59,350
the Shin Ah Foundation that I'm handing them over to.

411
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,100
Well,

412
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,800
Se Yeon will make good use of them.

413
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,180
Is your head...

414
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:06,230
I'll give up the management rights.

415
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,320
Min Hyeok!

416
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,360
That's not a decision you can make carelessly.

417
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,050
I didn't decide carelessly, but

418
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,850
I decided rationally.

419
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:15,140
You're better than me, Hyung.

420
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:19,380
I'm saying this for the K-Group, not as your son.

421
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,260
So,

422
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,530
against all odds, are you saying you want to 
go to that woman that doesn't make sense?

423
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,980
No.

424
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,200
I'm dying to go to her, but

425
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,260
I can't, because I feel embarrassed.

426
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,410
Embarrassed?

427
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:43,130
There is no one in the world who lives without sin.

428
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:48,330
It's important how you repay it.

429
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:52,320
That woman told me that.

430
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:55,210
I...

431
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,920
will pay for my sins.

432
00:34:58,950 --> 00:34:59,800
What?

433
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,630
The roughest place,

434
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:05,730
where no employees want to go, 
please send me there.

435
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,290
I'll work hard most seriously.

436
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,590
<i>Transfer Contract</i>

437
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,590
No.

438
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:32,110
I still haven't paid for all of the debt yet.

439
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:36,380
Please take it, otherwise I'll be in trouble.

440
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,310
You can pay the debt slowly.

441
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,330
A little at a time, slowly.

442
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:46,600
He has to hear from you even like that, 
so the Boss can withstand.

443
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:55,590
The boss...

444
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:59,170
is leaving for Armenia today.

445
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:01,790
Leaving?

446
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:04,910
He won't be back for a while.

447
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:38,900
<i>♫ One day that one day</i>

448
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:45,050
<i>♫ Each of us, we saw for the first time today</i>

449
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:52,340
<i>♫ Suddenly I felt suffocated and 
My painful memories</i>

450
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:58,290
<i>♫ Have all disappeared</i>

00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:02,140
<i>♫ I believe that I love you</i>

00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:08,900

<i>♫ If this limping love of mine</i>

455
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:19,840
<i>♫ If it moves near, because you might hide from fear</i>

456
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:25,820
<i>♫ Even though I say I'm hurt as if I could die</i>

457
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:29,520
<i>♫ I only watch</i>

458
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,470
<i>♫ Even though now is not the time</i>

459
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:39,260
<i>♫ I can feel you as you tremble</i>

469
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:27,830
You came?

470
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:30,080
What is it?

471
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,800
I'm going to close up the gallery and leave.

472
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:36,730
Before I go,

473
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:39,320
I wanted to see you, Do Hoon.

474
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,340
You must have heard the news about me.

475
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,640
Did you still want to see me?

476
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:50,030
I'll be indicted next week.

477
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,060
The person who killed Seo Ji Hee

478
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,210
is not Yoo Jeong, but

479
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:59,010
me.

480
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:03,860
That's why I wanted to see you more.

481
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:08,630
Because I thought I should tell you before I go.

482
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,970
The person who killed Seo Ji Hee

483
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:14,710
is not you, Do Hoon, but

484
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,680
is me.

485
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:24,460
<i>I told the Chairman that I'll marry Min Hyeok.</i>

486
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:29,030
<i>With Min Hyeok, this is as far as I would allow.</i>

487
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:32,800
<i>I'm pregnant.</i>

488
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,720
<i>We'll keep the baby.</i>

489
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,790
<i>Look here...</i>

490
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:38,950
<i>That baby,</i>

491
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:41,330
<i>do you think the Chairman will accept it?</i>

492
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:43,470
<i>No,</i>

493
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:45,950
<i>do you think he will let you give birth to it?</i>

494
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,510
<i>Please take it.</i>

495
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:59,070
<i>The Chairman doesn't know you're pregnant, yet.</i>

496
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:03,000
<i>Should I go and tell him right now?</i>

497
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:11,660
<i>Disappear. From Min Hyeok's eyes. Forever. Until you die.</i>

498
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,850
<i>This is my last warning.</i>

499
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:18,360
<i>Next time, there won't be this kind of a thing.</i>

500
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:28,930
I didn't know she would really turn up dead.

501
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:32,220
"I wish she would die."

502
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:37,640
At that time, I really thought like that.

503
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:44,510
I thought I would be happy, 
even if I have Min Hyeok like that, but

504
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:51,600
ultimately it seems Min Hyeok and I 
were not meant to be.

505
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:59,760
I am sorry.

506
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,800
Do Hoon, you got caught in the wind of what I started,

507
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:08,550
you were at the wrong place at the wrong time, that's all.

508
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:14,830
"Why did it end up like this?",

509
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:17,870
I thought about it over and over.

510
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:20,790
If that day I wasn't there,

511
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:26,690
if it didn't rain, if only the truck didn't pass by,

512
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:29,640
it was unfair.

513
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:35,220
Because I felt unfair about this misfortune 
that only comes to me, I grit my teeth.

514
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:39,930
I was afraid that everything I have built 
might crumble in one moment.

515
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:45,010
Then also Yoo Jeong,

516
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:50,050
also my child,

517
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:53,440
I have also lost my family and became like this.

518
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,510
Do Hoon.

519
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:59,300
The one who killed Seo Ji Hee is me.

520
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,530
It was my fault.

521
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:07,180
Thanks for all this time.

522
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:09,930
Please have a good travel.

523
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:17,120
I've heard,

524
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:22,150
the Shin Ah Foundation file,

525
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:26,760
that you never released it.

526
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:35,260
Thank you.

527
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,220
Your paintings,

528
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:47,600
I think I'll miss them.

529
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:06,200
Regarding the kidnapping of Kang Woo Cheol last month, 
are you acknowledging it?

530
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:06,980
Yes.

531
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:10,600
The hit-and-run incident at Route #6 4 years ago,

532
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:13,410
instead of Kang Yoo Jeong who served out the term 
due to the judgment at that time,

533
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:19,190
the fact that it was you <i>the defendant</i> who drove, 
do you acknowledge it?

534
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:27,840
The fact that you <i>the defendant</i> drove the victim, 
Seo Ji Hee, at that time to her death,

535
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:31,600
I asked you if you acknowledge it?

536
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,310
<i>Father, let me borrow your car today.</i>

537
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:42,010
<i>Where are you going that you are taking the car?</i>

538
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:45,600
<i>Do you need to go somewhere far?</i>

539
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,810
<i>I have things to do.</i>

540
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:53,010
<i>Yeah, you need a car to make sure you get there on time.</i>

541
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:59,410
<i>You have to do better this time. If you do like the last time...</i>

542
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:01,790
<i>Mom, I'm late. I'll be back.</i>

543
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:05,950
<i>Do Hoon, Do Hoon, this, this, just eat this.</i>

544
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:08,910
<i>I'll be back.</i>

545
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:13,330
<i>Prosecutor, take care.</i>

546
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:19,500
<i>Oh, right. But did you get your wiper blade fixed?</i>

547
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:23,540
<i>I heard on TV that it won't rain today for sure, so don't worry.</i>

548
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:27,870
<i>Aigoo... it must be nice living without worry all the time.</i>

549
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:31,470
<i>Aigoo, I'm going to eat my son's leftover.</i>

550
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,640
<i>Why isn't this working?</i>

551
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,560
<i>It's not working?
No... that's strange.</i>

552
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:50,600
<i>Wait here for just a moment.
- Okay.</i>

553
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:57,850
<i>Yes, Director.</i>

554
00:45:57,850 --> 00:46:01,720
<i>Yes, I am almost there. Yes.</i>

555
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:14,600
<i>I think Min Hyeok has gone to see that woman.</i>

556
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:19,180
<i>No matter what, bring me that child.</i>

557
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:02,050
<i>I love you.</i>

558
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:19,970
<i>Oppa!</i>

559
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:23,310
<i>Oh, Oppa!</i>

560
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:25,120
<i>I told you not to come out.</i>

561
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,430
<i>What was it?</i>

562
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,620
<i>Oh, I'm so relieved. What a relief!</i>

563
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:41,430
<i>Let's go quickly!
- Wait a minute. Let me clear it off the road.Other cars may have accidents, too.</i>

564
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:35,930
Defendant, do you acknowledge it?

565
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:41,050
Yes.

566
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:50,490
<i>RET</i>

567
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:56,050
<i>SECRET</i>

568
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:33,520
Wow, there is a look of president about you.

569
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,410
When did you come? 
- Early morning.

570
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,580
Did the preparations go well?

571
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,680
Are you really not going to regret it?

572
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:43,740
I have done enough regretting till now.

573
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,870
Ahjussi!

574
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:47,030
Min Joo.

575
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:49,130
Ah, you arrived?

576
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:51,380
We're going to be late, let's go quickly.

577
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:52,860
Okay.

578
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:58,590
Those two... what are they?

579
00:50:58,590 --> 00:51:02,370
While you were away, those two have been dating.

580
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:08,850
<i>My Hye Ri
Oppa, are you busy?</i>

581
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:10,570
You too, what?

582
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:17,770
Oppa will be there soon.

583
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:20,920
Then.

584
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:26,600
Hey, Gwang Soo!

585
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:29,780
Gwang Soo!

586
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:44,340
I saw Assemblyman Shin's wife yesterday at the shop, 
and her spirit was down.

587
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:47,710
Assemblyman Shin probably couldn't be 
on this presidential election, right?

588
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:49,770
I don't know.

589
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:56,170
Because they are the types who will crawl out somehow, 
once the dust settles.

590
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,960
Are you really not going?

591
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:00,900
Still, it's the presidential inauguration.

592
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:05,190
Why? Gwang Min will do well by himself.

593
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:09,390
You said he seemed like a son, but it was a lie.

594
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,580
Do you still want to give it to Min Hyeok?

595
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:17,630
Min Hyeok did as much as he could.

596
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:20,630
Now, let him live doing what he wants.

597
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:22,630
Attorney Choi...

598
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:25,370
President Choi should do alright.

599
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,940
Well...

600
00:52:27,370 --> 00:52:30,700
As the only son I have...

601
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,970
Aside from that, what do we do about Min Joo?

602
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:35,790
The age difference with President Choi is a bit too much.

603
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:39,170
She keeps insisting to get married.

604
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,610
She must be taking after you.

605
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:45,090
What?

606
00:52:45,090 --> 00:52:49,870
You also have lived well for about 20 years, 
after being with me.

607
00:52:56,810 --> 00:52:58,970
<i>2008. [Ahn Do Hoon's prisoner number]</i>

608
00:52:59,950 --> 00:53:01,510
Letter.

609
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:14,390
Ah, what's the occasion? A letter arrived for you.

610
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,910
Wow, it's the pizza bread!

611
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,740
Are you saying it's coffee franchise business?

612
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:01,200
Because they haven't completed the enrollment yet, 
it seems it won't be ready until next month.

613
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:04,990
I'll be the one selling that coffee. 
I'm so diligently going to that Barista Hagwon, because of that.

614
00:54:04,990 --> 00:54:07,550
This thing's not even paying the rent, 
with that as an excuse!

615
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,060
How about Ae Sook Unni?

616
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:14,410
Congratulations!

617
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:15,820
Where's Alex?

618
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:20,100
Are you calling a neighborhood dog? 
What do you mean "Alex", to your brother-in-law?

619
00:54:20,110 --> 00:54:23,780
My Alex... says he is inviting all of you!

620
00:54:23,810 --> 00:54:27,560
He said he will make a lot of Nigerian food.

621
00:54:27,610 --> 00:54:31,720
You look too pretty with your hair straightened out like that. 
You should've been making yourself pretty like that already.

622
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:37,180
What good does that do? 
The potatohead who said I would look pretty if my hair was straightened out, is dating some chick right here.

623
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:41,300
Omo, how are you? 
- Sure can't be the nobleman.

624
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:43,840
What would our Alexandra like to eat?

625
00:54:43,870 --> 00:54:46,280
Streusel bread.

626
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:48,760
Give me one of these too.

627
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:51,020
Yummy, yummy.

628
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:04,350
Forget it... ummm.

629
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:06,540
She-she's coming out, she's coming out!

630
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:11,680
- Hey, Unni, Unni!
- Hospital, hospital, hospital, go to the hospital!

631
00:55:11,690 --> 00:55:16,830
Get in first, get in. Okay, okay, it's okay.

632
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:20,810
Unni, I'll wrap things up here and go. 
So, go there first, ok?

633
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:55,550
It's sweet. I don't like sweet things.

634
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:04,330
I didn't come to see you,
I came because I'm curious about something.

635
00:56:05,330 --> 00:56:08,800
You made a wish that time at the Buddhist tower.

636
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,480
What was that you said then?

637
00:56:10,490 --> 00:56:11,460
I said that it was a secret.

638
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:13,640
Where is the secret, secret? When it's the end.

639
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:17,440
Once I let you know about everything, it won't be fun.

640
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,480
President,

641
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:22,360
you don't like things that are not fun.

642
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:31,920
It's not fun, so tell me what I'm curious about.

643
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:33,630
I don't want to.

644
00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:34,610
Why?

645
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:36,950
Because it has to be a secret,

646
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:40,340
so President can keep looking for me.

647
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:41,830
I am not a President anymore.

648
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:42,670
Is that right?

649
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:47,450
So, don't call me by "President" but by my name.

650
00:56:48,370 --> 00:56:50,750
You still have a lot more debt left.

651
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,850
Do as I tell you. Say it.

652
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,340
Min Hyeok.

653
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:05,930
Again.

654
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:08,810
Min Hyeok.

655
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:11,890
Again.

656
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,010
Min Hyeok.

657
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:22,450
Say it again.
