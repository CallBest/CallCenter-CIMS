00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,880
<i>Please believe me. There was nobody. 
No one saw anything.</i>

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,060
<i>On that rainy road, because a truck suddenly popped out,</i>

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,840
<i>my car slipped, and we...</i>

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,090
<i>No, I... Just that,</i>

6
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:19,510
<i>all I did was hit the barrel at that construction site.</i>

7
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:21,280
<i>I even got off the car and checked it myself.</i>

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,250
<i>But the barrel you keep insisting about 
was not at the scene!</i>

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,320
<i>Because it was in the middle of the road, I pushed it away 
to the shoulder because it would be dangerous.</i>

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,380
<i>Please try finding it again.</i>

11
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,800
<i>Find what? Just what are we finding?</i>

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,160
Gwang Soo...

13
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:38,830
Yes.

14
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,280
Kang Yoo Jeong said that

15
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,500
the accident happened, trying to avoid a truck.

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,100
That truck driver could be the only eyewitness.

17
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,800
Find that person,

18
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,860
and find out what happened that day.

19
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,500
Yes.

<i>I know Min Hyeok.</i>

24
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:07,030
<i>The look in Min Hyeok's eyes when he looks at that woman,</i>

25
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,430
it's love.

26
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,640
<i>♫ A person came into my life</i>

27
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,500
<i>♫ The person I should not love</i>

28
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:45,670
<i>♫ No I should not</i>

29
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:52,500
<i>♫ I tried to turn away many times</i>

30
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:59,390
<i>♫ I made that person cry</i>

31
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,640
This now...

32
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,500
It's alright.

33
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:08,300
You could have... made a mistake.

34
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,530
It was not a mistake.

00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:13,240
<i>♫ and disappear</i>

36
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:19,090

<i>♫ I believe that I love you</i>

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,700
<i>♫ It's shaking me like crazy</i>

39
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,600

00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,600

<i>♫ If it moves near, because you might</i>

42
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,290
Don't you think it'll be really dragging tonight?

43
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,500
Your wound is deep.

44
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,330
Perhaps you should go to the hospital...

45
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,500
<i>♫ I only watch</i>

46
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,950
Tonight, would you stay with me?

<i>♫ If the tears knew my heart</i>

55
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,690
No, it can't be farther from the truth.

56
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:06,170
The case of wrongdoing on the election 
was found not guilty.

57
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:09,300
All my father did was to go out 
to the local district for support.

58
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:14,110
It's something that has nothing to do with our foundation.

59
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,200
I'm hanging up, then.

60
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,080
Please drink. I just turned the switch off.

61
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,110
Regarding the Nanu Magic Construction 
that the K-Group is funding,

62
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,710
please make sure you get the approval as soon as possible.

63
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,040
This marriage…

64
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,050
are you really going to do it?

65
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,000
Do Hoon, you said

66
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,950
that you and I live in two different worlds.

67
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,050
In this world, I will end up getting married to Min Hyeok.

68
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,370
And that goes the same for Min Hyeok.

69
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,330
Things like love,

70
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,070
I don’t need it.

71
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,910
In my world,

72
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,580
are you in a relationship with me?

73
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,500
You don’t like it?

74
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,950
Did you get hurt a lot yesterday?

75
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,790
If you’re hurt more than the scar, then just say you’re hurt.

76
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,450
It’s hard to see you pretend you’re not.

77
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,000
I have a meeting at the foundation. I have to go.

78
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,520
Mom… mommy…

79
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,270
Oh no…

80
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:42,730
Hey!

81
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:50,550
Mo...mo...mommy...

82
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:53,100
Don’t cry… don’t cry.

83
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,700
Mommy… mom…

84
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,060
Oh? What is this? Look at this! What is it? It’s a car!

85
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,700
Oooh!

86
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,460
Mommy… Mommy… !

87
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,740
Mommy!

88
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,120
Where’s mommy?

89
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,860
You should say thank you.

90
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,930
Your child is so cute.

91
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:22,300
He’s only cute for a moment, I can’t take my eyes off him for a second.

92
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,540
Little nuisance.

93
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:29,310
Aigoo!

94
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,430
Again!

95
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,650
Aigoo...

96
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:43,920
Mommy...

97
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,750
<i>Mommy</i>

98
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,750

99
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,000
Drink.

100
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,660
When you're having a hard time,

101
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,040
you said if you drink this, you get strength.

102
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,750
I’m going to drop this.

103
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,420
It’s hot.

104
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,830
Thank you.

105
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,210
Are you going to keep avoiding me?

106
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,760
What happened that day…

107
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,280
I've already forgotten about it.

108
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,250
On whose account?

109
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,830
I told you it was not a mistake.

110
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,010
Boss…

111
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:27,520
I’m really busy right now.

112
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,440
But…

113
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,550
I came here… to see you.

114
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:37,700
Because even if I see you like this, 
I feel like I could live.

115
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:43,150
<i>♫ Even though I cannot say</i>

116
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:48,420
<i>♫ Hot enough to get burned 
The tears in my heart</i>

117
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:57,500
<i>♫ If I can pour it out to you 
My love</i>

118
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:03,590
<i>♫ For me to call</i>

119
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:07,310
It’s the contract for investment approval from Hannam-dong.

120
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,540
You're the one who made it happen.

121
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,480
Take this to Ahn Do Hoon, directly yourself.

122
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:16,430
Gwang Soo will give you a ride when you get off work.

123
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:18,770
Thank you.

124
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:25,890
<i>♫ I have a heart 
I want to shout, but</i>

125
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:30,730
<i>♫ I swallow it again today</i>

126
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,690
Since I saw you, even like this,

127
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,730
I'm ok.

128
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:47,780
<i>♫ I say please embrace but 
My love</i>

129
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:55,430
<i>♫ When my tears dry out
When my love fades away</i>

130
00:10:55,430 --> 00:11:02,010
<i>♫ You're going to be hurt too much</i>

131
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:05,600
<i>♫ My love</i>

132
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,000
There a guest here.

133
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,870
Please come in.

134
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:40,420
Please approve this contract from the legal team.

135
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,340
This isn’t something I can decide by myself.

136
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,860
Wait until the Board of Directors approve it.

137
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,940
It’s not because <i>you</i> don’t want to take it?

138
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,130
What are you talking about?!

139
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,830
It doesn’t look good...

140
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,330
seeing you desiring what others have.

141
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,410
That’s not something for you to say.

142
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:11,590
I had chances to get up here. If you’re done with your business,

143
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,190
go back.

144
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,280
Some chance...

145
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,190
No.

146
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:20,260
You came all the way up here by your own will.

147
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:24,760
Therefore the consequences, the responsibility, 
you're the one who must take them.

148
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,810
Don’t act like you’re the victim.

149
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,790
It’s repulsive.

150
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,980
I will come to get the documents tomorrow.

151
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:35,690
It’s Boss’ order.

152
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,550
What is it that you want?

153
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,740
You want me to compensate?

154
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,310
Compensate?

155
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,560
How could it be compensated?

156
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,550
For taking my child from me,

157
00:12:56,550 --> 00:13:00,230
you left my dad to die in the streets,

158
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,880
how much do I have to get to get enough?

159
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:07,440
I should ask around.

160
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,090
What will your parents say?

161
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,000
Kang Yoo Jeong!

162
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,290
Don’t call out my name!

163
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,560
I will take it. That compensation.

164
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,930
I'll get the right amount, so

165
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:26,550
make sure to prepare yourself.

166
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,750
I confirmed Miss Kang Yoo Jeong going inside her home.

167
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,410
Good job.

168
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:58,940
You can go now.

169
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,210
Miss Kang Yoo Jeong...

170
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:06,810
went to the bakery again after leaving Ahn Do Hoon's office.

171
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,330
There is something I'm curious about.

172
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,770
That bakery…

173
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,880
Why aren’t you returning it back to Miss Kang Yoo Jeong?

174
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,760
Because she might go away.

175
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:26,050
If I give it to her,

176
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,450
because she might disappear in front of my eyes.

177
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:06,130
<i>Sook Ja Unni</i>

178
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:10,200
Yes Unni, this is Yoo Jeong.

179
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,400
I have a favor to ask…

180
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,340
<i>I love you, customer!</i>

181
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,110
<i>Wow~ take this as collateral.</i>

182
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:37,970
<i>Customer?</i>

183
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,140
<i>Yeah, customer. I'm the customer you love</i>

184
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,190
<i>A person you should love.</i>

185
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,970
Yoo Jeong!

186
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,320
Unni, I’m sorry all of a sudden.

187
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,520
You know this isn’t allowed.

188
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,950
That’s why I am asking you like this.

189
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:00,280
Yeah…

190
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,090
You're not someone who would normally ask, either.

191
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,810
This isn’t something that will become a problem, right?

192
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:08,410
No.

193
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,910
The date was the 1st.

194
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:15,500
It was a car going southbound since 11PM… it has a high pass on it.

195
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,230
This...

196
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,140
It's the make and number of the car.

197
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:25,370
I need the data from when that car was coming back to Seoul.

198
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:38,510
Unnie, so…

199
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:41,180
why isn’t the boss showing up these days?

200
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,460
You know the boss doesn’t have time like that.

201
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:57,900
The Boss is very sick.

202
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:18,410
The fever that started from infection on his ankle is not reducing.

203
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,680
Then the hospital...

204
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,570
His physician already came and went.

205
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:24,660
Please help.

206
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:28,270
Well… what do I have to do?

207
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:31,730
I have work to do so I have to go out.

208
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,410
<i>♫ When I see you smiling</i>

209
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:08,480
<i>♫ I don't have to open my eyes to know it's a dream</i>

210
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:16,990
<i>♫ Even though I reach out my hand 
 There is no use</i>

211
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:24,360
<i>♫ After the love ended</i>

212
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:30,900
<i>♫ Back then I did not know</i>

213
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:38,880
<i>♫ Where you had stayed, 
there were only tears</i>

214
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:47,420
<i>♫ What if the memories all get wet
 What if they disappear too soon</i>

215
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:53,830
<i>♫ Although it hurts, 
I live on without crying</i>

216
00:18:53,830 --> 00:19:01,280
<i>♫ It's me who finally says that I love you</i>

217
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:08,940
<i>♫ The words I didn't know back then 
 The words I didn't want to hear</i>

218
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,950
<i>♫ In your flowing tears</i>

219
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:17,950
<i>♫ The fact I have lived there</i>

220
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:22,970
<i>♫ If I had also known it back then</i>

221
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,610
Don’t touch that.

222
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,100
You…

223
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,040
Why are you here?

224
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:46,880
Are you feeling better now?

225
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,690
Aren’t you hungry?

226
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,500
You haven't eaten anything all day.

227
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,120
But...

228
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,880
you didn’t injure your hands.

229
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:03,050
If you’re done, I will clean up and go now.

230
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,960
That orgel (music box)…

231
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,200
It’s my mother’s.

232
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:13,440
If it makes sound,

233
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,120
It keeps reminding me.

234
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:22,380
I wasn’t angry at you.

235
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:26,450
I was just scared.

236
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:28,930
What’s so scary?

237
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,240
My mother…

238
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:35,640
Passed away because of me.

239
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,400
If I didn’t go in that room.

240
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,330
No…

241
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:53,070
If I just didn’t wind it up again…

242
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,380
I just don’t want to think…

243
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,990
How much my mother would resent me.

244
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:14,540
There is no mother in the world

245
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,300
that would resent their child for that.

246
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:22,670
My mother was never happy in this house.

247
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:27,530
She was always standing by the window looking outside.

248
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:32,050
As if she can’t leave this house because of me.

249
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,700
It was like that.

250
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,880
Like that.

251
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:47,370
Boss, you’re mistaken.

252
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,840
I don’t know everything but,

253
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,870
A person who was going to leave,

254
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,530
will eventually leave.

255
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,780
It’s not that she couldn’t leave here because of you,

256
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,020
It’s probably that she could stay here

257
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:04,120
because of you.

258
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,790
If she knew how distressed you are now,

259
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:13,300
she would have more of a hard time.

260
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,260
I too…

261
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:25,590
Had a child.

262
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:31,150
So…

263
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:34,880
Believe what I say.

264
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,930
Just for a moment.

265
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:03,400
Stay here just for a moment before you go.

266
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:59,140
You’re pretty close with Kim Jae Ha from Se Gwang these days.

267
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:03,840
I owe Mr Jo Min Hyeok for making a friend.

268
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,720
I found out who spread the rumors

269
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,860
Of our president’s ailment.

270
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:14,830
It was Se Gwang.

271
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:18,480
Don’t forget the saying not to fix your hat under a pear tree.

272
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:21,260
(Korean proverb – if you fix your hat under a pear tree, you look like you’re reaching your hand out to steal a pear)

273
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,070
Please look here.

274
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:08,040
Look here too.

275
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,740
Don’t think of it as only my request.

276
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:13,350
In any case, our goal is to expand the restaurant.

277
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:15,330
Let’s stop playing games like this.

278
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,980
Games? 
-Like this.

279
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:22,480
Weren’t we always playing like this?

280
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:27,500
It’s all done, please follow me out.

281
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:29,380
It’s all done, please follow me out.

282
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:32,340
I have no time. I have a meeting for my father’s election.

283
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,600
The Wurthering Heights you gave me,

284
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,830
I finished it.

285
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,610
Revenge that started with love ends in tragedy.

286
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,630
Right?

287
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,200
I have to go.

288
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,270
What I want to know is,

289
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,950
If it’s the opposite…

290
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,550
Love that starts from revenge…

291
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,790
What happens to that?

292
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,200
Think about it.

293
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,810
The chairman approved and the legal department agreed to it.

294
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,100
Congratulations.

295
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,920
It’s not over just because you got the investment.

296
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:37,550
Se Gwang is still observing King’s Restaurant.

297
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:39,600
The Boss…

298
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,470
Isn’t going to let go of the restaurant that easily.

299
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,410
I stopped the media.

300
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:09,620
The rumors aren’t that great right now, but if things like this go out of hand

301
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:13,400
Who’s going to trust a company that’s owned by Jo Min Hyeok?

302
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,690
What are you trying to say?

303
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:18,120
If you look at it, it all happened just because of you!

304
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,860
You think it’s ok for all those employees

305
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,460
to be nervous because of you?

306
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:29,490
Don’t act like you care for those employees.

307
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,690
You only…

308
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:33,870
Want to protect your place.

309
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,920
Yeah, this place.

310
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:40,020
I have the responsibility to protect K-Group.

311
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:45,460
If Jo Min Hyeok falls, K-Group is in danger. I’m just saying this…

312
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:49,020
Because you are closer to Jo Min Hyeok than I am.

313
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,820
Tell Jo Min Hyeok to go to Kim Jae Ha

314
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:55,290
and kneel to apologize for letting this happen

315
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:59,250
because of one woman.

316
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,290
That...

317
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:05,360
Would be the best for K-Group and Jo Min Hyeok.

318
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,580
Yes Miss Se Yeon.

319
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,840
No, it’s okay.

320
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:19,730
I will be there now.

321
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:38,300
What are you doing here now?

322
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,390
I am sorry.

323
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,280
I would like to apologize.

324
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,580
Because of me you and my boss…

325
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:50,410
I don't think your apology is going to end it.

326
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,600
Jo Min Hyeok is some guy…

327
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:55,870
he sent you instead of coming himself?

328
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:58,830
No, it’s not that.

329
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:00,500
The Boss doesn't know.

330
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:04,290
It's a matter that has arisen because of me.

331
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:05,770
I will apologize to you.

332
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:08,500
What do you think you are doing?

333
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,200
You think this is an 80’s drama?

334
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,250
You,

335
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,720
Get up.

336
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,910
Get up!

337
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:29,740
Well, I did get some valuable information on the company,

338
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:34,700
But I still can’t get over the humiliation Min Hyeok gave me.

339
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,170
He has a great fiancée like Se Yeon,

340
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:43,650
And pretty girls all around him,

341
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:47,250
So what’s the reason why he keeps getting attracted to

342
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,170
a defected one like you?

343
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:56,170
Jo Min Hyeok’s taste I don’t get...

344
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:01,830
Here, pour a glass.

345
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:05,240
I will accept your apology depending on how you do.

346
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,860
Substitute.

347
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:48,570
Why are you coming only now?

348
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:52,400
I know it’s your day off but… 
aren’t you bit too late?

349
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:55,340
Where were you?

350
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,520
How is your foot?

351
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,010
Can you walk?

352
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,930
That's a relief.

353
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:12,460
I will go in now.

354
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,190
Substitute...ah!

355
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,370
Are you ok? Yeah.

356
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:22,520
Does it hurt?

357
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:25,780
It was ok because of you

358
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:28,520
but not so much right now.

359
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:34,110
You didn’t come with Gwang Soo?

360
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,550
You can go around by yourself?

361
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,820
Gwang Soo is in the middle of work.

362
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,310
Don’t mind him.

363
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,310
Oh…

364
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:47,930
Oh yes.

365
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:49,830
Here.

366
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,760
You went to get this?

367
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:04,080
Nothing happened?

368
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,310
No.

369
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:11,340
It’s late. You should go.

370
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:46,890
What the?

371
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:51,700
He’s all better.

372
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:55,030
That’s why you shouldn’t commit a crime in the first place.

373
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:59,060
The financial supervisory service requested the investigation, I can’t get by this one.

374
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:01,410
It was for fund raising purposes.

375
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:05,760
Lawyer Choi has to come and explain that.

376
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,570
I am not the most righteous but I do my best in the work I’m given.

377
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:12,370
You should be careful too.

378
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:15,660
Lawyer Choi can just say you or the president told you to do so.

379
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:18,470
You know he’s not that type of person.

380
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:32,010
You know Shin Hwa and Se Gwang is on to get K-Hotel?

381
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:35,860
I heard the rumor on his illness started from Se Gwang.

382
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,200
That woman

383
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,380
is from that hit and run accident 4 years ago right?

384
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:43,410
What are you guys doing?

385
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:14,250
I told you to do only what I told you to do.

386
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:19,270
Why are you doing things that I didn’t tell you to do?!

387
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:24,840
That’s…

388
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,380
Why did you go see Jae Ha?

389
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,300
Why did you pour him a drink?

390
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,820
To apologise.

391
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:34,780
I heard the company is in trouble, because of that incident.

392
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:37,000
Did Ahn Do Hoon say that?!

393
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,290
I just…

394
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:40,420
I was wrong, so if I apologised...

395
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,970
Why do YOU apologize?

396
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:44,200
Why is it always YOUR fault?

397
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:48,160
That was my fault! Taking you there was my fault!

398
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,980
I did it because I wanted to apologise!

399
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,880
I wanted to...

400
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,590
do something in your place.

401
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,330
Liquor?

402
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:03,880
Why not pour it?

403
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:07,070
I can kneel down if they want me to kneel.

404
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:09,310
If I can help my boss by doing that,

405
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:10,700
what’s so hard in doing it?

406
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,300
Why do YOU have to kneel down to help me?

407
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,610
That…

408
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,840
doesn’t affect me at all.

409
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:24,360
I…

410
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,760
I can’t accept that.

411
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,560
From now on,

412
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,850
don't kneel down to anyone.

413
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:34,180
If someone has to, it'll be me.

414
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:46,170
I can’t keep my position vacant too long.

415
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:52,030
Let me ask you one thing.

416
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:56,470
Did you do it because of me?

417
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:04,350
I don’t have any other reason… I was just…

418
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,880
Bothered…

419
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:12,110
Because

420
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:16,090
you might get into a difficult situation because of me…

421
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:18,870
I was just

422
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:21,710
bothered…

423
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:24,130
There's no other reason.

424
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,520
It’s been a while…

425
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:56,570
Chairman!

426
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:57,790
I'm fine.

427
00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:00,260
Dad!

428
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,380
Yes?

429
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,720
Min Joo, no!

430
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,330
Mum!

431
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:06,550
It's fine.

432
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:09,070
Still, Mr. President.

433
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:11,180
Mr. President is very tired.

434
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,300
You,

435
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,550
You’re not happy to see mom?

436
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:15,120
Mom…

437
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,760
did you get that makeup?

438
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,330
They only sell that in Germany. You got it right?

439
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,080
Yes, let’s go up.

440
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,900
Let’s go in.

441
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:39,930
I heard from Kwang Min.

442
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:42,570
The Investment on the restaurants.

443
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,640
Good job.

444
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,790
Investment is only the beginning.

445
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,530
We will raise business performance now.

446
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:52,350
Now you’re sounding like my son.

447
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:54,070
How is...

448
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,250
your health?

449
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,380
I don’t plan on passing things onto you yet.

450
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,190
Don’t worry.

451
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:06,250
You should go now.

452
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:09,480
And don’t look away.

453
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,620
We shouldn’t

454
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,790
let lawyer Ahn Do Hoon know yet.

455
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:25,740
Se Gwang has a big information network,

456
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:29,860
we do not know where the source leaked from.

457
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:34,010
And?

458
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:35,410
Sorry?

459
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:37,270
Kwang Min,

460
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:40,060
you have that face when you have something to say.

461
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:42,970
Just say it.

462
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,320
Lawyer Ahn...

463
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,150
started as a prosecutor in charge of Miss Seo Ji Hee’s

464
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:50,290
hit and run accident and came up here.

465
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:53,480
It seems like Min Hyeok is looking into that accident again.

466
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:57,060
Why?

467
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,880
It seems like a woman problem.

468
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,600
Oh, that jerk. Really.

469
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:12,430
Kang Yoo Jeong?

470
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:13,990
You've seen me before, right?

471
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:41,400
Sit down.

472
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,740
I heard that you're a restaurant employee.

473
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:57,460
Yes. I heard that she's a person that Min Hyeok chose personally.

474
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:05,300
You helped Min Hyeok and received an investment,

475
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:08,510
you've worked very hard.

476
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,740
The hard work, if you've done that much, it's enough.

477
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:21,480
You shouldn't have any more reasons to see Min Hyeok.

478
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:28,440
Answer him. The Chairman is asking you.

479
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,380
The thing is...

480
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:39,230
Min Hyeok is still less than mature so he's not discriminating when meeting people.

481
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:43,860
There has to be no more wounds to him from meeting people.

482
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:46,070
I thought that once would be sufficient.

483
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:52,440
It's enough. There's no reason to pull out something that's passed.

484
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:58,670
It seems like you understand what I am saying.

485
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:05,660
If you met unpleasantly, you should quickly separate.

486
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,020
Then go ahead and prepare the meal.

487
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,950
Yes.

488
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:15,270
What is this?

489
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:17,640
Don't talk in such a loud voice in front of the president, he is still...

490
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:23,460
Sitting a person down here, what do you all think
 you're doing?!

491
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,220
Let's go.

492
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:31,470
Go.

493
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,480
Kwang Soo.

494
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,060
What are you doing?

495
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:40,910
Let go. Let go, Choi Gwang Soo.

496
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:44,300
Butler Im. Let that woman out.

497
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,310
Yes.

498
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:53,730
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

499
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:56,400
I told you not to be sorry.

500
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,960
I told you definitely that you had done nothing wrong!

501
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,070
I'm sorry.

502
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:08,660
Kang Yoo Jeong. Kang Yoo Jeong!

503
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:11,810
Attorney Ahn,

504
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:17,650
I heard that you knew a way to handle that woman.

505
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:23,370
I don't think that I'll be able to dine with you.

506
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:26,910
I'll request that you take care of the back end clean up.

507
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:41,530
Attorney Ahn.

508
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:57,640
Did you see?

509
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,300
This is the difference between you and I, and them.

510
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:01,250
I know.

511
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:03,200
Don't get involved further with Jo Min Hyeok.

512
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:08,130
Then what about you? Until where are you going to get involved with Shin Se Yeon?

513
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:08,820
What did you say?

514
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:14,300
You advising me, you don't think it's presumptuous?

515
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:24,820
Thank you.

516
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:30,170
The Medic Alert Bracelet.

517
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:35,220
I went to the institute and you were listed as my dad's guardian.

518
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:41,780
In case you had started touching it up from there, 
I was worried.

519
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:44,740
It's a relief.

520
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:58,420
That woman, don't bother her.

521
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:01,140
I'll protect her. This time you really can't!

522
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:04,310
What are you saying in front of Se Yeon?!

523
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:07,680
It doesn't matter, Chairman.

524
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,790
The marriage is something that we have to proceed with anyway.

525
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:15,470
I'm not getting married!

526
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:20,090
Do you think you'll be able to do that?

527
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:25,440
Sitting in this spot, is something that even the dead Seo Ji Hee couldn't do.

528
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,800
There should be no reason for the woman who killed Seo Ji Hee to come into this house.

529
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:35,450
There will be no matter of you coming into this house either.

530
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:37,730
Gwang Soo, let go.

531
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:40,470
Let me go!

532
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:45,350
I'm not going to do this marriage! I don't need any of it!

533
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:48,860
Se Yeon and I, no longer have anything to do 
with one another.

534
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:51,560
You!

535
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:57,190
Chairman!

536
00:45:57,190 --> 00:46:00,790
Leave it!

537
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:06,610
Try saying that once more!

538
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:11,890
That woman, don't mess with her.

539
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:14,530
I won't forgive you, Father.

540
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:17,690
You!

541
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:20,290
That...oh.

542
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:37,720
Let go!

543
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,140
Move!

544
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:42,410
Let me go! I said let me go! Move!

545
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:45,020
Move! I said move!

546
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:48,980
Let go!

547
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:52,800
I'm worried.

548
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:22,560
Kang Yoo Jeong! Kang Yoo Jeong!

549
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:36,870
Yoo Jeong. Kang Yoo Jeong!

550
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:41,830
Kang Yoo Jeong!

551
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:46,190
Kang Yoo Jeong!

552
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:51,510
I know that you're here.

553
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:55,970
Kang Yoo Jeong!

554
00:47:57,690 --> 00:48:00,590
Kang Yoo Jeong!

555
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:12,660
Go back.

556
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:18,900
It's a relief.

557
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,660
I was afraid that you'd hide again.

558
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,520
Go! Please!

559
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,380
I won't make the same mistake twice.

560
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:28,270
I don't care, even if I get kicked out of K Group.

561
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:29,560
President...

562
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:33,410
You have to be here. I have to keep you here next to me.

563
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:36,230
Stop talking like a little child.

564
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:39,170
Aren't my feelings important?

565
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:43,030
Why do I have to get all that insult to be next to you?

566
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:45,770
Don't you feel the same?

567
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:47,360
You said also that I unsettled your nerves.

568
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:50,560
Yes, you do unsettle my nerves.

569
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:53,540
But that's all.

570
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:56,190
I'm just using you Boss.

571
00:48:56,190 --> 00:49:00,910
I am just using you because I am angry that

572
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:03,000
I broke up with Ahn Do Hoon that I loved so much.

573
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,060
So, please go back.

574
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:10,390
Substitute!

575
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:14,880
Substitute! Open the door!

576
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,450
Open the door!

577
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:21,860
Substitute!

578
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:24,400
Open the door!

579
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,250
Substitute!

580
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:31,670
Open the door! Open the door!

581
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:38,430
Kang Yoo Jeong!

582
00:49:38,430 --> 00:49:42,460
Please! Open the door!

583
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:59,480
When I look at you Boss... its difficult.

584
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:01,500
I want to forget,

585
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,500
Boss, you keep on bringing out the memory.

586
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:07,830
Come out.

587
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:11,750
Come out, come out! 
Let's talk facing each other.

588
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,570
I said come out.

589
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:14,660
Please stop this now.

590
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:22,200
I...

591
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:26,290
figured it out.

592
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:29,370
When that accident happened,

593
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,040
it's probably not just the barrel,

594
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:37,240
I knew it.

595
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:46,910
If I had paid just a little more attention, 
Seo Ji Hee...

596
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:52,240
She probably would be with you now, Boss.

597
00:50:56,170 --> 00:50:58,700
Because I was too happy at that time,

598
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:03,030
I was afraid what if my happiness shatters,

599
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,500
it's probably nothing,

600
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,750
I just believed it like that.

601
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:25,580
Because I was afraid of the poison,

602
00:51:28,270 --> 00:51:30,530
I avoided it.

603
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,450
So, Seo Ji Hee...

604
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,370
I killed her, is right.

605
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:52,740
Whenever I see you, that day comes to my mind.

606
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:56,830
Because I feel suffocated for the guilt feeling,

607
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:01,120
it's hard to see you, Boss.

608
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:05,660
Really anymore...

609
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,910
I don't want to see you anymore.

610
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:33,250
I'm going.

611
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:36,750
Because I'm going,

612
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:41,620
don't have a hard time.

613
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:46,000
<i>♫ we have changed</i>

614
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:50,520
<i>♫ Memories again today more and more</i>

615
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:53,300
<i>♫ Engulf me</i>

616
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:57,720
<i>♫ They became painful scars, and</i>

617
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:01,630
<i>♫ Engulf me</i>

618
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:05,050
<i>♫ Because of your changed heart</i>

619
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:12,080
<i>♫ Even my recollection must be trying hard to erase you</i>

620
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:17,020
<i>♫ Each of us, we have loved</i>

621
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:24,670
<i>♫ Each of us, we have shed tears
 Living under the same sky</i>

622
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:27,920
<i>♫ It was happiness to me</i>

623
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:35,700
<i>♫ You were like the sky to me
  In that when I only loved,</i>

624
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:42,680
<i>♫ That time, when I only loved, 
I want to go back to that time</i>

625
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:46,170
<i>♫ Each of us, we have loved</i>

626
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:49,750
<i>♫ Each of us, we have shed tears</i>

627
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:57,060
<i>♫ Living under the same sky
 It was happiness to me</i>

628
00:53:57,060 --> 00:54:04,760
<i>♫ You were like the sky to me
  In that when I only loved,</i>

629
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:10,450
<i>♫ That time, when I only loved, 
I want to go back to that time</i>

630
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:12,120
Boss!

631
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,870
What fault would it be of yours,

632
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:23,990
father has always been the first to you.

633
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:29,700
I found it.

634
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:35,690
At the day of the accident,

635
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:38,750
the truck that almost hit Kang Yoo Jeong's car.

636
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:40,710
I found it.

637
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,750
I'm sorry.

638
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:02,370
The sins I committed to you...

639
00:55:03,150 --> 00:55:06,040
I know I can't be forgiven, but

640
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:09,250
I still came shamelessly like this.

641
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:16,700
I'm sorry I dared.

642
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,440
I know I shouldn't, but

643
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:25,660
one day,

644
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:30,500
even if it was only one day,

645
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:34,710
I wanted to accept the boss's heart.

646
00:55:38,270 --> 00:55:40,950
I know it's something I should be punished for.

647
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:45,450
Even as I know that,

648
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:51,870
I wanted to hold that hand.

649
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:06,250
I'm sorry.

650
00:56:54,850 --> 00:57:01,730
<i>♫ Would it be alright if I move closer</i>

651
00:57:01,730 --> 00:57:06,450
<i>♫ I was scared so I stood still</i>

652
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:14,790
<i>♫ I wonder if we really had to meet</i>

653
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:20,460
<i>♫ I can't give an answer</i>

654
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:27,970
<i>♫ Because an unerasable scar hurts</i>

655
00:57:27,970 --> 00:57:34,700
<i>♫ Would I be able to tell you again that 
I love you</i>

656
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:41,480
<i>♫ No matter how many times I let you go, 
you're still the one</i>

657
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:48,300
<i>♫ No matter how hard I try to erase you, 
like an incurable disease</i>

658
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:58,650
<i>♫ Spreading inside of me
 I just can't stop this love Yeah</i>

659
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:01,110
<i>♫ I cannot take another step</i>

660
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:04,670
<i>♫ After fending off that suffocating piercing wind</i>

661
00:58:04,670 --> 00:58:07,550
<i>♫ That final night when I held you too tight</i>

662
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:12,020
<i>♫ That it was love passed and gone
 Can we reassure ourselves beginning tomorrow</i>

663
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:16,800
<i>♫ Because an unerasable scar hurts</i>

664
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:20,460
<i>I'll just be stubborn this once, Father. 
I won't go through the marriage.</i>

665
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:23,070
<i>Will you guys really be okay?</i>

666
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:25,320
<i>Wasn't this kind of thing, what you wanted?</i>

667
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:28,400
<i>What I want, is you.</i>

668
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:31,240
<i>If the chairman collapses, he will come back.</i>

669
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:32,470
<i>I'll help you.</i>

670
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:35,560
<i>Attorney Choi will have to be appearing at the Prosecutions.</i>

671
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:38,170
<i>I don't know if I can do this.</i>

672
00:58:38,170 --> 00:58:40,670
<i>Perhaps because it's more recent than the hit-and-run,</i>

673
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:42,860
there were may clues I could find.

674
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:46,130
<i>It doesn't end like this.</i>
