00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,820
Let's go. I have something to say.

3
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,990
What are you?

4
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,560
You, just what have you done?!

5
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,410
You...

6
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,260
What have you done?

7
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,550
What are you doing right now?

8
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:44,680
That's something for me to say.

9
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,480
Go.

10
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,400
Don't go.

11
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,450
In front of me,

12
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,300
don't... give orders to this woman.

13
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,500
I have no reason 
to hear something like that from you.

14
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,540
You don't?

15
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,330
You don't?!

16
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,420
Oppa!

17
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,060
Are you crazy?

18
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,880
Why do you keep hitting people?!

19
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,210
What...

20
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,910
Just what are you?!

21
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,080
I'm so annoyed.

22
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,630
Oppa, are you ok...

23
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,060
What will make you listen to me?

24
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,810
Jo Min Hyeok...

25
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,400
He knew of the relationship between you and me.

26
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,870
What are you saying?

27
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,640
He knows about us, and he's doing this kind of crap!

28
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,610
No way!

29
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,600
Are you saying he knew, but still let us meet?

30
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:25,800
That's why I told you to stay away from him.

31
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,510
Yes.

32
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,100

<i>If he asks you to, </i>

46
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,700

61
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,990
Now then,

62
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:51,160
with 8 votes, 
which is more than half of 12 directors,

63
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,760
President Jo Min Hyeok's 
dismissal case has passed.

64
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,700
You!

65
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,610
What are you doing?

66
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,470
I put you next to Min Hyeok in order for you to take care of him.

67
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,920
Where were you and what have you been doing 
to result in this kind of mishap?

68
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,370
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,870
If you say sorry, does that resolve everything...

70
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:28,270
Stop, Father.

71
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,070
It happened while he was taking care of some business I asked him to do.

72
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,860
The board of directors

73
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,820
passed a Dismissal Case against the President.

74
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,210
What are you talking about?

75
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,610
Among those who voted yes,

76
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,590
Shin Se Yeon was also included.

77
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,300
Get out.

78
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,050
Father.

79
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,340
Get out immediately.

80
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,820
Is it you?

81
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:33,740
It wasn't enough what you did to Jae Ha, 
you also did this to Do Hoon?

82
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:37,240
You do this to a person and not a word of apology?

83
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,280
I told you not to take someone else's side in front of me.

84
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,080
The apology,

85
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,270
I'm the one who should get it.

86
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,180
What apology are you talking about?

87
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,420
What apology?

88
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,690
Jo Min Hyeok! 
- What apology?

89
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,760
What are you doing? Jo Min Hyeok!

90
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,180
Do Hoon, go.

91
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,900
If you wanted the hotel, why didn't you just say it?

92
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,600
Then, I would have just given it to you 
as your wedding present.

93
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,440
It's not that I wanted the hotel.

94
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:26,440
It's not enough you bring that woman to a place, 
where everyone we know is present,

95
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,620
you'd even fist fight for that woman?

96
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,090
To what extent will you go?

97
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:33,430
Do you know how pathetic you made me look?

98
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,010
Se Yeon, the Chairman can hear.

99
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,270
Don't you dare butt in!!

100
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,220
Let's go.

101
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,310
If he had kept his president's position as is,

102
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:05,270
the situation was that it would've been difficult 
to set his foot back in the hotel.

103
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,560
That's why

104
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,180
Se Yeon, you raised your hand, and

105
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,660
pushed out Min Hyeok first?

106
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:15,410
There were two people who were definitely on your side,

107
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,510
I confirmed it.

108
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:21,130
If we call back Min Hyeon again next year at the reorganization of the board of directors...

109
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,950
That...

110
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,420
It's not you, but

111
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,240
it's for me to decide.

112
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,990
Here.

113
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,830
It's too obvious Gwang Min is on my side, so it won't work.

114
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,270
This...

115
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,190
Where it got conceptualized,

116
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,720
why don't you find out?

117
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,690
Yes.

118
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,770
What's wrong with your lips?

119
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,860
It's nothing.

120
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,190
<i>I don't think I've paid for my sins.</i>

121
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,380
<i>For my whole life...</i>

122
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,980
<i>I won't forget it for my whole life. 
How could I forget?</i>

123
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,730
<i>What I'm ashamed of...</i>

124
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,580
<i>is what I had done to that person who passed away.</i>

125
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:21,280
<i>You saw, but you just left, 
is this correct?!</i>

126
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,380
<i>Yes. I did it. </i>

127
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,400
<i>What more do you want? </i>

128
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,610
<i>Tormenting me all this time,</i>

129
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,640
<i>isn't that enough? </i>

130
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,200
Crazy bastard.

131
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,690
Just what did she do?

132
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,710
Gwang Soo,

133
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:02,750
how could there be such a revolting thing?

134
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,850
I only confirmed they were at the cafe.

135
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,250
Whether they were in the car together, I'm not sure...

136
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,010
After the proposal...

137
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:18,290
When they came back, in that rain,

138
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:19,430
they went separately?

139
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,500
Does it make sense?

140
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:58,630
Jae Ha, it seems he will keep his word this time.

141
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:03,560
No matter how low down dirty his behavior is, 
the name Se Gwang is not something we can disrespect.

142
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,920
He wants you to directly apologize to him.

143
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,740
Go see him right away tomorrow.

144
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,740
Apology?

145
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:20,050
I can do that as much as he wants. Instead...

146
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,820
tell that son of a bitch to apologize first, 
to that woman he wronged.

147
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,830
Who is that woman?

148
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,760
Someone that worries me.

149
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:44,090
A woman who bothers you, 
first, you have to be careful.

150
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,140
<i>What is this? 
A defective good?</i>

151
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,950
<i>I heard that you do anything you are asked to if you are given money. </i>

152
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:11,890
<i>Where do you come off all expensive? 
 Hey!</i>

153
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,680
<i>Go buy some clothes.</i>

154
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,380
<i>She does do everything she's told. 
Only what I tell her to do.</i>

155
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:30,560
Are you not going to talk about what happened yesterday?

156
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,610
If you bury it like that,

157
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:52,350
your insides are going to rot completely.

158
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,250
That, that, that. 
Seeing that you're laughing, there is a problem.

159
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,320
Why? Just rest!

160
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,300
You were burning with fever yesterday.

161
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,570
Do you know how I got this job?

162
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,750
What is that clothing?

163
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,480
Is that really yours?

164
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,300
I'll be back.

165
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,540
Substitute driver.

166
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,710
Substitute driver.

167
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,700
Kang Yoo Jeong!

168
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,560
<i> Jo Min Hyeok, 
he knew about the relationship between you and me.</i>

169
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,050
<i> He knows about our relationsip, and he's doing this kind of thing!</i>

170
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,610
What is it this time again?

171
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,210
Just what is it that you want from me?

172
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,160
How far would you have to go 
before you'll feel relieved?

173
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,960
How long do you plan to keep your mouth shut?

174
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,420
What are you talking about?

175
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:18,750
What is it that you're trying to guard by going this far? 
Tell me with your mouth.

176
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:24,190
You and Do Hoon, what are you two hiding?

177
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:38,000
Everyone!
Everyone!

178
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,240
I am a woman that has killed someone.

179
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,140
A hit-and-run criminal.

180
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:47,070
I deserve to be stoned to death!

181
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,730
Hey!

182
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,900
I said it.

183
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,350
Are you satisfied?

184
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,530
Isn't this what you wanted?

185
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:57,170
Substitute driver.

186
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,070
Is this not enough?

187
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:02,000
Do you want me to run into the road?

188
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,720

189
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,730
Get a hold of yourself!

190
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:17,900

191
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,570
Are you crazy?

192
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:25,430
Yes, I am crazy. 
I wish I was really crazy!!

193
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:38,800

194
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,860
Hey!

195
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,450
Kang Yoo Jeong!

196
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,970
Are you crazy?

197
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:01,600
Aish!

198
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:14,900
<i>♫ Would it be alright if I move closer</i>

199
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:19,190
<i>♫ I was scared so I stood still</i>

200
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:28,390
<i>♫ Did we really have to meet</i>

201
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:33,690
<i>♫ I can't give an answer</i>

202
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:40,680
<i>♫ Because an unerasable scar hurts</i>

203
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:47,940
Gwang Soo, how could she do that?

204
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,190
<i>♫ No matter how many times I let you go</i>

205
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:55,170
Even putting her life on the line,

206
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:58,730
what would it be that she wants to keep?

207
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:01,440
I'll go get the car.

208
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,660

209
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:13,970
It's alright.

210
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,640
I have nothing to talk about with you.

211
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,900
Tell Min Hyeok to come and bow down.

212
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,100
There is no way Jo Min Hyeok will come himself.

213
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,240
So he'll just send an attorney and forget about it?

214
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:57,450
You can just beat it.

215
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:00,720
The media article due for tomorrow, 
 why don't you fold it?

216
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:06,660
Oh my... What kind of era is this, 
for a mere company to control the media?

217
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,750
You can stop the false modesty.

218
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:14,470
If you write them, 
don't they become the public opinion?

219
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:25,120
The cancelled event of the K-Hotel this time,

220
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,410
will go on as planned.

221
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:32,170
You, what do you see me as?

222
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:36,850
The new Chairman, 
who will lead Se Gwang in the future.

223
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,350
Please look at what's in the envelope first, then talk.

224
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,210
What do you want to do with this?

225
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:06,000
Only spreading some dirty rumor about Jo Min Hyeok, 
you wouldn't be satisfied with that.

226
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:22,270
<i>Excuse me?</i>

227
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,400
<i>Yes, why?</i>

228
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,800
<i>You've never lost in an argument, right?</i>

229
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,140
<i>Not yet.</i>

230
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,470
<i>If you become a prosecutor, you will probably always win. </i>

231
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,660
<i>Probably. </i>

232
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,370
<i>Then will you help me when something 
unfair happens to me at that time too? </i>

233
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:42,730
<i>I'll help people without money and power unconditionally.</i>

234
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:44,350
<i>What about the people with money and power? </i>

235
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:48,310
<i>Well those people find their own way.</i>

236
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:51,470
<i>What would I do if I go to find you 
and you act like you don't know me? </i>

237
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:01,280
<i>In the future, come find me with this. </i>

238
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,500
<i>I will act like I know you. </i>

239
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:44,350
Just as you shudder at the thought of seeing me, 
it's hard for me, too.

240
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:49,970
I don't ever want to see you again.

241
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,740
It's not because of you Se Yeon.

242
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:41,160
Jo Min Hyeok turning out like this, 
I'm saying it's not because of you.

243
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,610
Do Hoon, there are times when you're scary.

244
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:50,490
Just by looking at my face, 
how do you know what I'm thinking?

245
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:55,120
You're right. That's a big problem.

246
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,300
Have you eaten?

247
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:00,800
Why? You should know by just looking at my face.

248
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:24,240
It's for looking after the hotel in place of me, 
that I pay you a handsome salary,

249
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,500
I don't believe I pay you to date my fiancée.

250
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,230
Why does it matter who I meet?

251
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:37,800
As long as we marry according to our contract, 
dating or whatever, you said I was free?

252
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,640
You have to at least be discreet with whom you date

253
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:44,010
to suit your class.

254
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,660
Don't concern yourself over him.

255
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:04,190
Because Min Hyeok probably doesn't either.

256
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,550
Se Yeon.

257
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,340
Dinner.

258
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:11,070
Where should we eat?

259
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,550
You'll probably get your clothes all smelly.

260
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:34,000
Because this is this first time, 
Do Hoon brought a woman to our restaurant.

261
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,700
She is a person who works with me.

262
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,910
Give it to me. I'll do it.

263
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:41,110
This, all of it, I did all the work and dried it myself.

264
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:45,470
I fried it with oil so it'll taste good.

265
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,800
It looks good. I'll eat well.

266
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,340
Okay.

267
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:54,660
Oh, your fingers are quite long.

268
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,880
They're pretty.

269
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,960
What do you do?

270
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,690
Since you work with Do Hoon, are you a lawyer?

271
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:07,600
No, I paint.

272
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,630
Paint?

273
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:14,300
No wonder, I knew your ambience was different.

274
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,870
Where is your house?

275
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:20,110
What does your father do?

276
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:22,110
Mom!

277
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:24,900
We came here to eat comfortably.

278
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:28,570
Aigoo, aigoo, I was acting out of line...

279
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:34,190
Aigoo, this... You probably don't know how to eat, 
so I'll have to assist you.

280
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:43,960
It tastes good. Thank you.

281
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:47,260
Please eat a lot.

282
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:58,480
Min Hyeok, starting tomorrow, look after the restaurants.

283
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,920
Doing extracurricular activities will help you.

284
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,840
Just take the restaurants and be gone, 
isn't that what it is?

285
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,360
Since I at least gave you that, you should be grateful!

286
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,660
The person who made the situation like this now, 
it's you!

287
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:15,450
Cleaning up after you, 
it's Ahn Do Hoon who did it all.

288
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:17,420
You better be embarrassed, kid!

289
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,210
Father.

290
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,750
Taking care of you ends right here.

291
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:24,980
Your bread and butter, 
from now on, you protect it.

292
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,070
Chairman.

293
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:30,150
Don't you think you need to give more shares to Min Joo?

294
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:34,180
How can they push people out like this, 
as they want?

295
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:37,020
If you want to return to the hotel even tomorrow,

296
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:40,240
the regional offices you're assigned to this time, 
do a good job with them!

297
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,350
Why don't you Ahjussi just be the President, 
instead of Oppa?

298
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,020
He would be so much better than Oppa.

299
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,120
Min Joo.

300
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,070
What?

301
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:52,890
Isn't it more comfortable for you too, Oppa? 
Because all you'll have to do is play.

302
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,850
Aish.

303
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:58,960
Chairman.

304
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:04,190
Do I not know my father?

305
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:07,770
There is no way my father would have brought in a person, 
without any background investigation.

306
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:09,620
So?

307
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:13,180
He probably shed any dirt if he had any.

308
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:18,670
Your data on Attorney Ahn Do Hoon's investigation, 
turn all of it over to me.

309
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:28,280
Hey, are you not going home?

310
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,160
I'm waiting for Yoo Jeong...

311
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,790
-yo. (making it formal)

312
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,560
Unni!

313
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,160
What happened? You didn't even come to work!

314
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,990
What is she talking about? You went out to work.

315
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:46,540
I told them that you were sick today, but

316
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,210
if you don't come without contacting...

317
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:50,680
Sorry. I'm sorry, Hye Ri.

318
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:55,690
You've been really weird since yesterday. 
What's going on?

319
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,660
Just talk.

320
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:04,670
I'm so frustrated, frustrated. I'm so frustrated!

321
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:07,660
I'm the one who is crazy, asking that stone-buddha.

322
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:11,960
Do you still not know that if unni closes her mouth once, 
it's the end?

323
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:20,760
What is this? That's Boss's secretary, 
did you come with him?

324
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,990
Tell him to come in!

325
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,870
Yes, Mr. President.

326
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,260
Now you're even keeping a watch on me?

327
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:38,000
<i>Getting people to do this, it's displeasing.</i>

328
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,930
Do I really have to disappear from you,

329
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:42,820
before you'll end this?

330
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:47,170
Substitute, if you do what you did today again...

331
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:11,230
That's because I'm worried. . . 
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>

332
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,810
<i>It's my fault.</i>

333
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:16,590
I told you not to do what you'll be sorry for.

334
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,830
That's okay. Come back.

335
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:23,600
And... tomorrow morning, call Ahn Do Hoon.

336
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,040
Yes.

337
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:42,590
Since you got promoted thanks to me, 
shouldn't you at least say a word of thanks?

338
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,570
Yes.

339
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:47,610
Thanks to you I have more work, 
I'll have to go to the office right away.

340
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:49,510
Is that so?

341
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,430
Okay.

342
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:58,170
Don't worry about Kang Yoo Jeong. 
Because I confirmed she is doing well.

343
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:04,170
Yoo Jeong... 
She is not a woman for you to treat carelessly like that.

344
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:07,560
Me? No.

345
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,600
It may not seem it, but I'm really concerned over her.

346
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:13,750
At any event,

347
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:19,990
however I treat Kang Yoo Jeong, 
do I need permission from you for that, Attorney Ahn?

348
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:22,480
Isn't she not a woman detached from you now?

349
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,520
If not, is there a problem for me being with that woman?

350
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:35,390
They say even hateful connection is still binding, 
the more I see her, I feel more closely binding.

351
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,950
She's an interesting woman.

352
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:56,290
If it's a story that doesn't matter to me, 
I'll not listen anymore.

353
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:00,670
I took quite a bit of your time.

354
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:05,730
Alright, while I'm not here, 
you'll have your hands full managing the hotel.

355
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:08,050
Keep up the good work.

356
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,740
Let's start visiting the branch offices in Seoul from today, 
and let your face be known.

357
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:17,450
Work regarding restaurant management, 
an employee from the main office will accompany you.

358
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:22,100
Attorney Ahn, I have let the security team know,

359
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:26,270
were you able to find the black-box data alright?

360
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:35,900
On the next prosecution investigation, 
I think we can use them as data.

361
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,690
I have to go to a meeting, so. . .

362
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:51,560
President, at 2 o'clock, 
Shin Se Yeon wants to see you in the work room.

363
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,150
Se Yeon?

364
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:15,960
Did you have good time on your date yesterday?

365
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:18,370
Yeah.

366
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:19,950
That's a relief.

367
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,670
The one who got Do Hoon participating in the hotel work, 
it was you I heard?

368
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:32,000
He must have done a lot of work for the K-Group, 
for him to be approved by the board of directors?

369
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:33,590
Was that something I could do alone?

370
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:37,150
If your purpose was to get me angry,

371
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:39,500
then you've succeeded.

372
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,610
Why did you want to see me?

373
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:48,400
The food we'll provide during the weekend, 
for the children on the small islands,

374
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:52,100
I would like one of your restaurants to sponsor it.

375
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:53,590
Okay.

376
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,210
That's it?

377
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:59,230
You're saying you want to do a good thing, right? 
Let's do it.

378
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:04,150
The Chinese food that will go to the correctional facilities, 
it will be sponsored by K-Hotel.

379
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,030
Are you having fun?

380
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:06,640
What?

381
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,690
Providing for here and there with a shallow sympathy,

382
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:13,550
comforting yourself, saying "I'm a good person."

383
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:15,840
What are you trying to say?

384
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,750
You and I, we are both in this position 
thanks to our parents, so

385
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:21,480
don't pretend to be high and mighty by yourself.

386
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:27,560
Using Ahn Do Hoon as if you want me to watch, 
do you have enough confidence to say you're not?

387
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:31,280
Or could you really have fallen in love with him?

388
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,770
As you said, 
it doesn't matter to me whether you love or date, but

389
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:36,000
Ahn Do Hoon that jerk can't be the one.

390
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,790
Jo Min Hyeok.

391
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:39,900
But then, was that even necessary?

392
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,050
I know you a little bit.

393
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:47,430
Shin Se Yeon, you're not someone who gives up so easily.

394
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,150
Get out.

395
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,990
If you have something to ask in the future, 
you come find me yourself,

396
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,430
instead of telling me to come and go.

397
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:16,550
<i>♫ Back then I did not know</i>

398
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:23,790
<i>♫ Where you had stayed, 
there were only tears</i>

399
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:27,500
<i>♫ What if the memories all get wet</i>

400
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:31,740
<i>♫ What if they disappear too soon</i>

401
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:38,130
<i>♫ Although it hurts, 
I live on without crying</i>

402
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:45,620
<i>♫ It's me who finally says that I love you</i>

403
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:53,230
<i>♫ The words I didn't know back then 
The words I didn't want to hear</i>

404
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:57,270
<i>♫ In your flowing tears</i>

405
00:33:57,270 --> 00:34:02,230
<i>♫ The fact I have lived there</i>

406
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:06,790
<i>♫ If I had also known it back then</i>

407
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:37,440
The bakery building,

408
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:41,560
it's correct that it became the property of the company Jo Min Hyeok is the CEO of, but

409
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:45,090
because it's the company's estate, 
he shouldn't be able to do whatever he wants.

410
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:47,220
I can stop that myself.

411
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,570
Take this.

412
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:55,090
Oppa.

413
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:56,980
I said take it.

414
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:58,900
Use this to pay back Jo Min Hyeok.

415
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,300
I will take care of that myself.

416
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,650
Until when are you going to act foolish?

417
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:05,730
Just what are you going to do to pay him back?

418
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:09,050
I help out here during the night and work during the day.

419
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:10,300
What kind of work?

420
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,130
It's at the restaurant.

421
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:16,470
If I work well, I might be promoted and work at the office too.

422
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:20,500
That restaurant. . .

423
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,680
Did you know that Jo Min Hyeok was the CEO of it?

424
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,390
What?

425
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:26,450
If you want to be the fiddle in Jo Min Hyeok's hand,

426
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:27,510
do it alone if you want.

427
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:29,110
Oppa, I didn't know about that.

428
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:31,350
Then take this money!

429
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:37,480
I'm not giving you this, so you'll like it, 
I'm giving you this, so I can be comfortable!

430
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:39,350
And this is what I ask, please...

431
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:41,400
get away from Jo Min Hyeok.

432
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:45,140
Because of you, he is tightening his ropes around me, too!

433
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,770
You said you wanted us to be comfortable.

434
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:49,580
You said you wanted us to stop being sorry for each other.

435
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:53,250
Then why are you like this? 
Why do keep making me feel sorry for you?

436
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:57,470
Until when are you going to be like this?
 Seriously, until when?!

437
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,450
Detective Choi?

438
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,100
This is Ahn Do Hoon.

439
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,480
Did you see that yesterday?

440
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,240
Ahh! Daebak! 
- Ugly! Really ugly...

441
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,890
It was everywhere on the face.

442
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:38,930
Kang Yoo Jeong.

443
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:41,460
Hello.

444
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:46,300
Kang Yoo Jeong.

445
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,590
Long time, no see.

446
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:53,470
Someone turned you in, 
for trademark violation.

447
00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:00,250
Legal Team, Director Ahn Do Hoon.

448
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,340
Ahh. . .yes. . .

449
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,800
Last week he came by and copied some files.

450
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,500
What files?

451
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:11,300
Between April and July, 
those who have worked with Pyungchang construction,

452
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,720
the reports of the Management-Team's vehicles.

453
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,120
What else?

454
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,500
Nothing.

455
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,750
Those files, send them to me too.

456
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:24,210
Okay.

457
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:29,890
From today, the Chairman ordered 
that you manage the sales of the restaurants.

458
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:34,410
Okay. Let's go before more gets taken away from me.

459
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:44,090
The vehicle reports and the black-box videos, 
how far do you go back in safeguarding?

460
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:46,960
For director level and above, it's 5 years.

461
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,500
5 years?

462
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:52,700
5 years.

463
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:00,630
Wait a moment!

464
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:07,270
Hello, Director.

465
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:14,720
By the way, why is the president 
suddenly looking for the black-box backup files?

466
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,950
I think he said there was something to confirm.

467
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,790
First, lets do it after we eat dinner. 
because I didn't get to eat lunch.

468
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:26,950
But, is there a need to backup the black-box videos?

469
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:31,850
Ahh, there was a time when a virus wiped out all HD.

470
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:44,020
<i>It's not that I don't know you are a good worker.</i>

471
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:48,980
<i>But this is a service job and it doesn't look good having police officers look into here.</i>

472
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,740
Substitute driver.

473
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:54,750
What are you doing not working?

474
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:59,340
I'm not here to see you.

475
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,600
Didn't you know I was the CEO here?

476
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,870
No.

477
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:07,860
I should have left on my own, if I knew, but

478
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:10,460
I stuck here to earn money. I'm sorry.

479
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,600
What are you talking about?

480
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,550
Take it.

481
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:29,320
It should be worth several months.

482
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:33,580
Please stop torturing me.

483
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,360
Where did you get this money?

484
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:39,050
Why does it matter?

485
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:41,550
Isn't getting my debt back all you needed?

486
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:44,960
No matter what I do or however I make the money, 
it's not something you should be concerned about?

487
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,920
Substitute driver.

488
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,910
Just!

489
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:49,530
Please!

490
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,450
Leave me alone.

491
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:03,640
I'll pay you back the rest, no matter what it takes.

492
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,730
She quit?

493
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:15,270
That. . .actually she was fired.

494
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:23,900
Some police officer came by and the officer 
looked like a robber and... talking about hit-and-run...

495
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:30,350
And, she had a bad incident previously and he scared her, so

496
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,890
the boss told her not to come anymore.

497
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:48,340
Unni.

498
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:52,340
What happened?

499
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:54,090
Why did you come early?

500
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:55,060
Unni!

501
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,710
When we were going around selling bags, 
someone must have turned us in.

502
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:00,620
Aish, how can we get caught after only one time?

503
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,210
Such bad luck. 
- Aish.

504
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:07,290
It's alright. We only had a few samples so we only have to pay a fine.

505
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,260
Let's just sell what we can sell.

506
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,160
Why try to make a few more bucks...

507
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:16,260
Hey, when the police officers were suddenly barging in here,

508
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:20,480
when I thought about going to jail again 
and not being able to see my son for a few years again, my heart just dropped.

509
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,500
Unni.

510
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:24,100
Should I give you a sedative supplement also?
 There's a new one that came in.

511
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,430
I'm sorry, Unni.

512
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,400
I'm sorry.

513
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:30,840
Why are you sorry?

514
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,010
I'm the one who did wrong.

515
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:34,730
It's because of me.

516
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:37,640
I'm sorry.

517
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:46,540
The detective who came to the store today,

518
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:49,150
is someone Ahn Do Hoon was close with 
when he was a prosecutor,

519
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:51,100
called Detective Choi Do Hyun.

520
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:45,910
Are you not answering the phone, Lawyer Ahn?

521
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:57,610
You must have been surprised at the ringing phone sound.

522
00:42:58,650 --> 00:42:59,720
What are you doing?

523
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,540
That's what I want to ask.

524
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,560
Attorney Ahn, what are you doing here right now?

525
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:11,460
You're cute when you're baffled.

526
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:14,450
Talk.

527
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:16,630
Why you came here.

528
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:20,360
Regarding the whereabouts of 
Assemblyman Shin and Chairman Jo...

529
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:24,840
Stop talking nonsense and tell me why you're here.

530
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:26,990
Should I tell you then?

531
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:32,460
The secret inside there...

532
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:37,510
Because it might come out... You came here to hide that.

533
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:43,470
What would it be... That secret?

534
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,470
There is no such thing as secret.

535
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:53,060
I don't know what you're looking for, but

536
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:54,900
if you can find it, try finding it.

537
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,630
Fine, Ahn Do Hoon.

538
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:58,520
With your life on the line, 
try to keep that secret.

539
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:02,840
Because I will reveal it with my own hands.

540
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:54,200
Pushing Jo Min Hyeok out,

541
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,400
you're not going to regret it?

542
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,390
If I was going to regret it, 
I would not have started in the first place.

543
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:01,170
Why did you go that far?

544
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:03,040
Min Hyeok...

545
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:07,430
Because he has too much, 
it seemed that he couldn't see me next to him.

546
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:10,150
If you keep Jo Min Hyeok next to you,

547
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:11,620
do you think you'll be satisfied?

548
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:13,190
Even if I go that route,

549
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:15,270
I must have him at least once.

550
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:17,400
If you want, Se Yeon,

551
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,980
I will help you.

552
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,400
What Jo Min Hyeok has,

553
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:25,420
I'll take it all away for you.

554
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:27,060
You, Do Hoon,

555
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:29,930
why are you so trying to take Min Hyeok down?

556
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:33,440
Are you two some kind of bickering enemies?

557
00:45:39,110 --> 00:45:42,060
Do Hoon, you sent it to the 
Board of Directors' meeting, did you not?

558
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,100
Earlier when you were investigating the 
business transactions of our Gallery,

559
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:47,500
it was the file that was there together.

560
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:49,410
That. . .

561
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:52,400
I didn't tell Min Hyeok.

562
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:56,090
Looking from a high place,

563
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:58,760
does the world look a little different now?

564
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,420
I can't tell yet.

565
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:05,530
But it's true I'm curious.

566
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,790
How high do I have to go up,

567
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:16,410
before you'll hold my hand?

568
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:19,180
I don't know.

569
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:23,580
Try going up as high as you can.

570
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:28,300
Because if you can't have it,

571
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,300
it will be better to destroy it.

572
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:38,040
For the time being, 
in place of President Jo Min Hyeok, who is vacant,

573
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,480
To help with the hotel management, 
a person from the Main Office Legal Team,

574
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,900
I introduce Director Ahn Do Hoon to you.

575
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:54,900
I'm Ahn Do Hoon.

576
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:59,460
Yes, I found the data.

577
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:04,210
Yes, please don't worry. I took care of it.

578
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:06,530
Yes.

579
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:10,400
Where is my father?

580
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,980
Because of his trip to Germany next week, 
he went to the Main Office for a little bit.

581
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,840
He's going out quite often these days.

582
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,170
What happened?

583
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:24,420
Oh, it's nothing much.

584
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:28,040
At the remodeled restaurant, 
I would like to throw a food tasting party, and

585
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,510
I wanted to ask my father about it.

586
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:33,240
It looks good, you're working hard.

587
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:36,500
Once you solidify your position as his successor, 
the Chairman will also feel more assured...

588
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,060
Successor?

589
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:43,600
Because my father has all the good stuff, 
I got a long shot in taking over.

590
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,630
Working hard can't be bad.

591
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:47,650
That woman who caught your attention,

592
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:51,120
did it all go well?

593
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:12,730
Substitute!

594
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:13,500
Substitute!

595
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:17,090
Where are you going like that?

596
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:18,400
Where are you?

597
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,400
Why are you barging into another's home?

598
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:22,350
Kang Yoo Jeong!

599
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:32,740
Where is Yoo Jeong?

600
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:34,840
Why are you asking me that?

601
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,420
The person who ran away to avoid you.

602
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:56,080
Substitute!

603
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:18,450
Let's have a talk.

604
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:27,300
Why are you asking me that?

605
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:32,420
After Kang Yoo Jeong left my restaurant, 
she gave me the money she didn't have, and left!

606
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:36,580
A few days ago, she contacted me.

607
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:38,390
She seemed to be scared of you, so

608
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:41,190
I helped her a little.

609
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:42,680
Well, that's all.

610
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:43,990
As you know,

611
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:45,790
because she is a woman who doesn't matter to me.

612
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:49,550
But why do you act like she is a woman who matters?

613
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:50,810
What do you mean?

614
00:49:50,810 --> 00:49:55,850
What she is hiding, I'm sure you know better than me!

615
00:49:55,850 --> 00:49:57,690
I'm curious

616
00:49:57,690 --> 00:50:00,290
whether there is a secret in this world 
that can be kept forever,

617
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,500
if there is.

618
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:11,080
You are the one who appears anxious, Jo Min Hyeok.

619
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:16,450
You wouldn't be looking for Kang Yoo Jeong to receive
money you have in abundance.

620
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:19,480
Is it because you're bored

621
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:22,500
to have lost the toy you've been torturing?

622
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:31,990
If you have nothing further to say, may I excuse myself?

623
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:37,610
Yes, this is Ahn Do Hoon.

624
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:40,880
Yes. Of course.

625
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,620
You can decide as you're accustomed.

626
00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:06,760
<i>Message: $161.00 was deposited into Joeun Bank.</i>

627
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:12,490
Ugh, Kang Yoo Jeong. Where are you now, huh?

628
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:17,170
Gwang Soo.

629
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:22,900
Find the bank where Kang Yoo Jeong deposited 
money into my account from today.

630
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:25,730
Search that area thoroughly!

631
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:27,460
Yes, sir.

632
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,390
Do you not paint anymore?

633
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:48,620
I don't have the desire.

634
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:54,330
What was that about with Min Hyeok earlier?

635
00:51:54,330 --> 00:51:58,530
Did you call me because you were curious about that?

636
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:02,660
He was looking for Ms. Kang Yoo Jeong.

637
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:08,230
What I said about Jo Min Hyeok, 
that I thought he had feelings for you, I'll correct it.

638
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:13,480
He just didn't want to have you taken away. That's all.

639
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:16,580
Would I...

640
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:21,070
not be the one?

641
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:27,470
If I move up higher,

642
00:52:28,030 --> 00:52:31,130
would an opportunity also come to me?

643
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:41,860
<i>♫ Would it be alright if I move closer </i>

644
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:45,050

649
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,520
<i>to 5 years imprisonment.</i>

659
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:56,490

<i>♫ I can't hold it in anymore, my memories toward you</i>

00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:35,350
Who said I hid?

681
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:40,230
I needed a job, so I came down.

682
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:45,170
And, I didn't avoid you out of fear, but

683
00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:48,370
I avoided you because I didn't want to see you.

684
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:51,090
Yoo Jeong, are you all done now?

685
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:53,050
Yes, please go home and rest.

686
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:54,140
Okay. Good job.

687
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:58,570
Yes. See you tomorrow.

Please have a safe trip home.

689
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:06,500
Don't smile.

690
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:10,850
Don't smile in front of other people.

691
00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:27,340

00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,690
Hello! Good morning.

696
00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:56,930
I'm hungry. Give me some food.

697
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:08,620
It's not meal time yet. Please leave.

698
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:10,030
I'll just wait until it's time.

699
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:11,410
Why are you being this way?

700
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:14,420
I'm hungry, I said.

701
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:33,310
<i>Hello. </i>

702
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:36,320
<i>Hello. Yes! </i>

703
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,120
<i>Please give us some food. </i>

704
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,230
<i>Okay. </i>

705
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:42,680
<i>Yes. </i>

706
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:44,680
<i>Please also get us some seaweed. </i>

707
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:51,050
Get out.

708
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,930
I told you I'll pay you back.

709
00:58:06,930 --> 00:58:10,040
Even if I have to work in places like this, I will pay
my debt.

710
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:12,810
So why did you follow me to here and act out?

711
00:58:12,810 --> 00:58:16,800
Are you going to kick me out again by telling people
 that I killed someone and that I'm a criminal?

712
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:19,120
Why are you doing this!

713
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:22,470
Is that all you take me for?

714
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:27,070
Okay. I'll give you that.

715
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,080
At any rate,

716
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:34,520
regardless, let's go back (to Seoul).

717
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:39,510
Let go. Let go.

718
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:41,190
Let's go back!

719
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:43,580
Let go. Let go!

720
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:45,070
Why are you like this, are you crazy?!

721
00:58:45,070 --> 00:58:46,840
That's right. I feel like going crazy!

722
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:51,450
Because you worry me so much, I feel like going crazy! 
That's why you stay right next to me!
